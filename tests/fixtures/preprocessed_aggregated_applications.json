          "title": "DeSpace QF: Public Goods Funding in Space",
          "description": "# Project Title: DeSpace Quadratic Fund\n\n## Abstract \n\nTo align the Decentralized Space Exploration Ecosystem for public goods funding, we propose the DeSpace Quadratic Funding Grants Round. This initiative aims to raise and distribute funds to support the DeSpace ecosystem.\n\n## DeSpace Examples: \n- DAOs\n- NFT collections\n- Metaverses\n- Blockchain Nodes\n\n## Background: \nIn the previous community-driven [Decentralized Science Round on Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x6e8dc2e623204d61b0e59e668702654ae336c9f7), there was significant demand for Hardware & Decentralized Space Exploration projects. This round also laid the groundwork for the DeSpace QF because of intense preparations that built on top of the success of [DeSpace: Space Founder Circles](https://www.spacefoundercircles.com/) in collaboration with ReFiDAO. With the current momentum in the Web3 market, the project aims to fund public goods related to Outer Space using Quadratic Funding.\n\n## Problem Statement: \nStartups and research projects often face challenges in securing initial funding and public awareness. For Public Goods projects, such as Open Space/Lunar, funding challenges can hinder long-term independence and the acceleration of innovative space technologies.\n\n## Solution: \nThe rising popularity of DeSpace presents an opportunity to establish a platform that unifies the broader DeSpace ecosystem with aligned values as outlined in the [DeSpace Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWnfN8l2VlQA-n5QxNH9oDdJ1soqe-_EaQmVfi_G_9g/). The DeSpace Quadratic Fund aims to achieve this.\n\n## What is Decentralized Space Exploration: \nDecentralized Space Exploration is a sub-niche within web3 merging space exploration with decentralized systems. Instead of being dominated by major national space agencies or billionaires, this approach allows multiple entities or individuals to participate in space missions. Leveraging blockchain and community-driven initiatives, it promotes open-source technology, collective decision-making, and crowdfunding. This democratizes space activities, fostering inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation in Space by distributing control and participation across a broader community.\n\n## Public Good Definition: \nA Public Good is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. In the context of the \"DeSpace Quadratic Fund\", it refers to projects that benefit the broader decentralized space exploration community.\n\n## Quadratic Funding Explanation: \nQuadratic Funding (QF) is a democratic funding method for public goods. It prioritizes the number of contributors over the amount contributed, ensuring projects with broad community support receive appropriate funding.\n\n## Benefits of Quadratic Funding for Space Public Goods: \nThe first framework is proposed in the [DeSpace QF Lightpaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygLWjt32Na3fCXvuruUyoNKaXqS3urfkr63FjnTPMo0/). Using QF for space-related public goods ensures projects with wide community backing receive amplified funding. This approach captures the public's desires and needs, making it ideal for supporting space-related public goods projects.\n\n## Benefits: \n- Attract relevant DeSpace project audiences.\n- Raise awareness across the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Position as a hub for the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Provide initial funding and promotion for researchers and projects.\n- Create a Proof of Concept for Public Goods funding in Space Science.\n\n## Risks: \n- Insufficient initial funding.\n- Funding the wrong projects.\n- Potential for fraud and Sybil attacks.\n- High Gas Fees.\n- Challenges in KPI measurements & user onboarding.\n\n## Learnings from the Last Decentralized Science Round: \nThe team will leverage tools like Gitcoin’s Passport and Sybill Analysis Toolkit, switch to Optimism for low Gas Fees, and involve the B2B team for engagement.\n\n## Why this team? \nWe aligned leading DeSpace innovators, scientists and entrepreneurs from Space DAOs like [MoonDAO](https://moondao.com/), [SpaceRoxDAO](https://spacerox.org/), [Alpha Persei](https://alphapersei.com/) and [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to sit on one table, start this initiative and grow our ecosystem for the benefit of all!\n\nWe already committed advisors and supporters from [Copernic Space](https://copernicspace.com/), [Lunargistics](https://lunargistics.com/), [Axiom Space](https://www.axiomspace.com/) and [Astrocool](https://astrocool.com/) offering special perks to grantees or donors besides the Space DAOs already involved and more to be announced soon.\n\nConfirmed grantees are companies mentioned before, as well as, [Orbuculum](https://dlteo.com/), [MoonSociety](https://www.moonsociety.org/), [Lunco](https://lunco.space/), Open Lunar Comms and many more to be confirmed soon.\n\n## Objectives and Key Results: \n**Objective #1:** Conduct DeSpace QF Round on Gitcoin Grants Stack\n**Key Results for Objective #1:** \n- Raise a minimum of $25k from sponsors.\n- Draft Eligibility Criteria.\n- Get at least 10 grantees on the platform.\n- Facilitate the round.\n- Plan and execute co-marketing.\n- Build a DeSpace Cornerstone Fund for future Rounds\n\n## Metrics to measure success: \nMatching Pool Fund size, number of grantees, number of donors, amount and number of donations, marketing engagement metrics, number of sponsors/advisors, cross-promotion activities by grantees.\n\n## Founding Stewards: \n@ManuelOlariu\nManuel Olariu is the founder of DeepVenture.io and with Copernic Space he is building a space asset marketplace leading Innovation and IP standards. He is responsible for MoonDAO B2B while he is supporting various Decentralized Science and Decentralized Space activities. He led the last community-driven #GitcoinBeta Decentralized Science Grants Round utilizing Gitcoin's Grants Stack where MoonDAO played a critical part as the main initial sponsor of the Round.\n\n@_Difint_\nRod Mamin is a systems engineer, with commercial experience building and sending robots to the Moon, Founder of LunCo.Space, Grantee on DeSci & Open Source Software Gitcoin’s GR15, Alpha Round, Beta Round and MoonDAOs Space Engineering Guild Initiator and Ex-Steward.\n\n@PaulBurg_\nPavel Anisimov is an environmental scientist, with experience in public goods and decentralized communities.

          "description": "# We are the movement towards a more sustainable and equitable future in #Medellín.\n\nThe goal of the node is to nurture community conversations around Web3 enabled regenerative-oriented-innovations (ROIs) and empower the youth in Medellín to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\n## Brief explanation of this project:\nWith this project we will develop the ReFi understanding and with it we will improve the environmental and social impact that new ventures can have in the Region, creating a new focus for ReFi projects and understanding, helping us to grow economically without destroying our environment and our lives in the process. We also work hand in hand with ReFiDAO helping to onboard more people into the ReFi environment.\n\n## Objective for this funding: \nWe want to carry out onboarding activities so that more people learn about the ReFi movement and focus their projects on this path and philosophy.\n\nWith greater awareness of the existence of this type of projects and technologies, we are sure that they will add very well to the city's trend of new technology-based ventures, progressively creating a boom in ReFi companies in the region with global impact.\n\nOur aim is to empower the youth in Medellín to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\n## Budget\nWe intend to raise 28.200 USD that will be well spent to generate the following ambitious outcomes:\n\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #1: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #2: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #3: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #4: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #5: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #6: 700 USD\n\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #1: 1.000 USD\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #2: 1.000 USD\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #3: 1.000 USD\n\n- Medellín Eternal Spring Activity #1: 1.500 USD\n- Medellín Eternal Spring Activity #2: 1.500 USD\n\n- Medellín Blockchain Community ReFi Workshop #1: 1.500 USD\n- Medellín Blockchain Community ReFi Workshop #2: 1.500 USD\n\n- ReFi Hackathon #1: 2.500 USD\n- ReFi Hackathon #2: 2.500 USD\n\n- Incubate and Invest One Social Entrepreneurship that come out from ReFi Medellín Hackathon #1: 5.000 USD\n- Incubate and Invest One Social Entrepreneurship that come out from ReFi Medellín Hackathon #2: 5.000 USD\n\nWe believe that through ReFi Medellín, we can create a more socially inclusive and ecologically regenerative urbanism. Your support will enable us to make a significant impact on the lives of young people in our community, and we appreciate your donation.",

Join us in the adventure of reconnecting all the people  regenerating our country, with our capital city San José at the center of a collaborative movement to transform Costa Rica into a ReFi Lab for the World.\n\nFor our second Gitcoin Round we need your support to consolidate [Verano ReFi Costa Rica 2023: Regenerating our Optimism](https://www.cambiatus.com/es/verano-refi)  an inspiring collection of ReFi events to share what is possible and what is already happening in ReFi in Costa Rica..\n\nFor our second Gitcoin Campaign we have a goal to raise $20k to make the full vision of Verano ReFi Costa Rica a reality!\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai1KygCkTiE)\n\n\n## Project Overview:\n\nThe ReFi Costa Rica Local Node project is dedicated to advancing regenerative finance and decentralized technology adoption in Costa Rica. With a special focus on areas beyond the capital city, San José, the project aims to foster a thriving ecosystem that promotes sustainable development, economic empowerment, and community engagement.\n\n![photo ReFiCosta Rica](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2ad4fd8-761f-42c5-9489-c5441891cb2f_1024x683.jpeg \"group shot refi costa rica\")\n\n\n## Project Goals and Impact:\n\n+ _Local Engagement and Sustainable Development:_ The project seeks to introduce regenerative finance principles to regions such as Monteverde, Paraíso and Osa. By organizing events and workshops, it aims to showcase how decentralized technologies can drive sustainable economic growth while preserving the local environment and culture.\n+ _Regional Empowerment:_ Through events in Monteverde, Paraíso and Osa, the project aims to empower local communities with innovative financial solutions. These solutions can align with regenerative practices, leading to the creation of sustainable livelihoods, businesses, and initiatives that benefit the region's unique characteristics.\n+ _Community Collaboration:_ Collaborating with local partners, the project aims to facilitate collaboration among community members, organizations, and universities. By fostering a sense of shared purpose, it encourages the exchange of ideas, resources, and knowledge, leading to the creation of impactful regenerative projects.\n+ _Inclusive Governance:_ In collaboration with [Cambiatus](https://www.cambiatus.com/), the project is committed to co-designing a governance framework that reflects the principles of regenerative finance. This framework aims to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and community-driven decision-making, enhancing the long-term sustainability of the local node.\n+ _National and Global Integration:_ The project's vinculation with bigger events and organizations such as the II Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica during [Blockchain Jungle](https://blockchainjungle.com/) event and the Blockchain Week Costa Rica 2023 leadered by [AsoBlockchain](https://asoblockchain.org/) showcases the country's dedication to regenerative finance practices. Additionally, the involvement in the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon underscores Costa Rica's commitment to sharing insights on impactful governance and decision-making.\n+ _Educational Advancement:_ Through collaborative master classes with [ULACIT](https://www.ulacit.ac.cr/) and [VIU](https://www.universidadviu.com/) universities, the project strives to educate students about the intersection of regenerative finance and decentralized technologies. By nurturing a skilled workforce, it aims to empower young minds to contribute to the sustainable development of Costa Rica's economy.\n\n\n \n## Budget Breakdown:\n\nTotal Budget: $20,000\n\n_**15% Event Planning and Execution:**_ Funding will be allocated to organize events in Monteverde, Osa and Paraíso, covering venue rentals, promotional materials, and logistical expenses. \n\n_**25% San José Event Collaborations:**_ Contributions towards monthly crypto meetups in partnership with AsoBlockchain, and organization of the II Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica during Blockchain Week Costa Rica 2023. \n\n_**10% Educational Workshops:**_ Costs associated with conducting master classes in collaboration with universities to educate the local community about blockchain technology. \n\n_**25% Governance Co-Design:**_ Allocation for collaborative efforts with Cambiatus to co-design an effective governance structure for the local node. \n\n_**25% ReFi DAO Event Participation:**_ Funding to attend the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon, representing Costa Rica and contributing insights to the global ReFi community. \n\n\n\n## Expected Outcomes:\n+ Increased awareness and adoption of blockchain technology in Monteverde, Osa and Paraíso.\n+ Stronger blockchain community engagement through San José events and collaborations with AsoBlockchain.\n+ Enhanced knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology through educational master classes.\n+ Well-defined and inclusive governance framework for the ReFi Costa Rica Local Node in collaboration with Cambiatus.\n+ Meaningful contributions to the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon, elevating Costa Rica's presence and impact in the global ReFi community.\n\n>**We invite you to be a part of this transformative journey by contributing to our campaign**. Your contribution will directly impact the growth and success of the ReFi Costa Rica Local Node and its endeavors. Together, we can drive regeneration, education, and innovation in Costa Rica's blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n## Results from Gitcoin Beta\nFor our Gitcoin Beta campaign we aimed to raise $50k to support “Verano ReFi” a series of events inside and outside San José and start working on our own website and learning path.  Considering the amount we raised with the mazing support from the Gitcoin Community and the ReFi DAO and Metacrisis matching funds (~ $5k) we decided to focus on one big event and a series of meetups to keep building our community, as well as creating content for social media and growing our following. \n\n## Events\nWe were able to organize and support the following events in San José, Costa Rica: \n\n1 One day event, our I Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica.  +40 people attending, 8 projects presenting, 3 keynotes\n7 Cripto Cantinas ReFi. Reach:  +140 people\n3 events as guests: +95 people\n\n\n**I Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica (40 people attending)** \nOn June 24th, 2023, the 1st ReFi Costa Rica 2023 Gathering took place in Barrio Escalante, San José. The event saw the participation of over 30 individuals and organizations who are driving regenerative finance initiatives from all corners of our country. The event was graced by the presence of Anna Kaic, representing ReFi DAO from Mexico, and was co-organized by Cambiatus, Gaia Impact, Sendero, and Diamante Bridge Collective – all founding organizations of ReFi Costa Rica.

This is why we believe in the importance of launching a local node and promote regenerative agriculture practices here.\n\nThe needs to improve the ongoing initiatives are many, but the most important ones are uncorrelated communities solving humanitarian, climate and food security issues, which are all very entangled and deserve a neutral place to connect, open dialogues and implements regenerative practices on the ground together.\n\nI see an opportunity to bridge the ReFi community with the international organizations making efforts on these issues but lacking grounded and capable people to execute on solving locally proven experiments that need the backing to scale internationally.",

Any additional funds will be used to expand our reach and impact through marketing and outreach efforts.\n\nHere are some of our upcoming projects:\n- Food for Tomorrow: [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1km7fDG2BITpqyEXfCysY5uI1mVawK018416EOUU97n8/edit?usp=sharing)\n- \"Dobru\" & \"Growth Guides\": [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y3O3YJwJBrpJDYSPLdk8duU8MC6bddzSIgTopmOe8w/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur success will be measured by the number of individuals and organizations that are able to access resources and support through our network, as well as the impact of the projects and initiatives that we support.\n\n![Innoveren voor het Klimaat, Innovators Buzz](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/6382/y9lz4J.jpg)\n\nOur team consists of:\n\n**Timothy Goudzand**\n*Co-Founder at Infinitri*\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/goudzandt), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timgoudzand/)\n\n\n**Sedale Wijngaarde MSc.**\n*Co-Founder @ Infinitri | Community Manager @ Tradetomato*\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/DaelyBasis), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daelij/)\n\n\n\n**Isabelle Caldeira MBA.**\n*Operations Manager at Banking Network Suriname N.V.*\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelle_cal), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelle-caldeira-suriname/)\n\n\nReFi Paramaribo has the potential to transform Suriname's economy and catalyze positive social and environmental outcomes. Your support will help us transition towards a more sustainable and equitable future for Suriname and the global south.\n\nThank you for considering us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![ReFi Paramaribo](https://images2.imgbox.com/e6/07/tWHXYIY9_o.png)\n\n\n*Feel free to schedule a call with us [here](https://calendly.com/t-goudzand/refi_paramaribo) !*\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "As a part of an evolving network of coordiNATIONs, ReFi Lisboa is cultivating a regenerative startup society in one of Europe’s top web3 cities here in Lisbon, Portugal. Based on the core belief that we need to heal the world within in order to heal the world around us, we are bringing together regenerative technology, art, music, design, and economics to create a new culture in the capital of this beautiful country here in Portugal.\n\nIn November, we’ll host the inaugural gathering of regenerative startup societies—bringing key local and international leaders together to explore how we can fulfill a single unifying mission:\n\n*Regenerate the earth using the most powerful tools of our time.*\n\n![annual-meeting-portugal-narrow.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/521w124n/annual-meeting-portugal-narrow.jpg)\n\n## ReFi Annual Meeting — Gathering of Regen CoordiNATIONs\n\nAfter hosting 10 events and reaching over 700 leaders across public, private, and third-sector institutions, we’re taking our next step forward by hosting the ReFi Annual Meeting and inviting local and global leaders of regenerative coordiNATIONS to gather for the first ‘Davos of ReFi’ on Nov 6-7 in a prestigious city center location on the day after ETHLisbon.\n\n[REQUEST AN INVITE](https://tally.so/r/nGKZPe) 💌\n\n---\n\n## Gitcoin GG18 ambitions\n\nWe are aiming to raise $7500 in GG18 to continue to onboard talent and capital into the regenerative economy via web3 rails. This funding will be spread across three key initiatives:\n\n- **Monthly events (x3):** $3000\n- **Community & growth:** $4200\n- **Onboarding stations:** $300\n\n**Total:** $7500\n\n---\n\n![refi-lisboa-july-group.jpeg](https://i.postimg.cc/yNp9FhFb/refi-lisboa-july-group.jpg)\n\n### Recap from Gitcoin Beta\n\nThanks to the $3680 we received from Gitcoin Beta along with support from [Celo](celo.org), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/), we’ve been able to host 5 events, reaching over 328 leaders across web3, finance and impact. In partnership with [African Data Tech](https://www.africandata.tech/) and [Positive Blockchain](https://positiveblockchain.io/) we seeded [an initial directory app](https://ling478.preview.softr.app/) of the key people and projects of the regenerative society in Lisbon through an integration with [Catalist.network](http://Catalist.network). We also hosted our first [Gitcoin Activation Station](https://www.notion.so/How-to-host-an-activation-station-71c1676071444f7e930deec0672b3812?pvs=21) and created an open source guide as apart of the ReFi DAO Local Node Toolkit!\n\n---\n\n## Our vision\n\nWe aim to balance the power of technology with conscious awareness by establishing a physical network of regenerative leaders and spaces across various sectors and problem areas. We are bringing together public, private, and third-sector institutions, as well as thought leaders in environmental, ecological, social, and cultural domains.\n\nWe see ourselves as an accelerator for the regenerative economy embedded within existing institutions to help them harness the power of regeneration and work towards a prosperous future for all.\n\n![workshop-refi-night](https://i.postimg.cc/9X6d8Bv3/workshop-refi-night.jpg)\n\n## Meet the team\n\n- Emilie Viallon - People Lead & Events\n- John Ellison — Source Steward\n- Laura Malta — Events & Community Lead\n- Susanne Zapelão — Marketing\n- Rica Amaral — Partnerships & Events\n- Emiliano Gutiérrez - Product\n\n## Advisors\n\n- Carolina Carvalho — Ecosystem Mapping\n- Eduardo Marques — Strategy & Partnerships\n- Tariq El Haj Omar — Regenerative Project Development\n- River Roberts — Regenerative Real Estate\n\n## Technology is key\n\nWe believe that technology encompasses not only hardware and software, but also the incredible low-tech solutions that have existed for millennia, such as meditation, yoga, breath work, plants, and various forms of medicine.\n\nJoin us. 🙏🏼\n\n## 2023 OKRs 🗓\n\nFor the next 6 months, we want to achieve the following:\n\n1. Identify 2-3 land-based regenerative projects as a pilot for project development 🏜\n2. Release a hard-copy of ‘Lisboa Regenerativa’ and distribute it to 10,000 Lisboetas and tourists via local shops, cafes, restaurants, and tour providers 📔\n3. Announce a formal partnership with NOVA University, the University of Lisbon, and the City of Lisbon Municipality—hosting our first event together 🏫\n4. Host three volunteer days serving homeless, orphans, and refugees as a community.  🥗👨‍👩‍👧‍👧\n5. Spread the story of regeneration. ♥️☀️🤗\n\n![plsd_prw-87.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XY89v6X3/sheep-dj.jpg)\n🐑 We love sheep... who doesn't?\n\n## Finances\n\nAs of today, all funds are managed by a [multi-sig on Ethereum](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x728b09639453F3047E36D063C64C91b3871aFD92) and an [Open Collective account](https://opencollective.com/refi-lisboa) thanks to support from [all4climate](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao)!\n\n## Every DAI counts!\nWhether you're based in Lisbon permanently or just plan on swinging through, we'd be incredibly grateful to receive your support in GG18!\n\nSee you on the other side Regen! 🤙",

The immediate plans involve expanding the network, nurturing and incubating grassroots projects, and actively seeking funding for local regenerative initiatives. By fostering an ecosystem of collaboration, the project aims to ensure the long-term viability of sustainable ventures.\n\nWhat we have done so far:\n\nWe launched the local node during the Prague Blockchain Week, where we hosted an opening ceremony for the local regenerators and entrepreneurs.\n\nWe are writing a blog and running a podcast about the regenerative movement, which includes the \"I SEE\" model - a conceptual framework that integrates the principles of individual happiness and authenticity, social connections, economic/energy systems, and ecological alignment towards a regenerative future.\n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/daliborcerny.eth\n\nWe foster collaboration between many local individuals and entities, recognizing the importance of tighter connections between the public and private sectors.\n\nOur ultimate goal is creation and innovation in line with the principles of nature, which includes biomimicry approaches and designs, building of supportive networks, sharing, and striving for personal happiness of everyone involved.",

          "description": "TL;DR:\nWe are seeking funding through this Gitcoin grant to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania. Our project focuses on creating a waste regeneration system that integrates blockchain technology to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable finance practices with waste pickers at the heart of it all. We invite you to support our initiative to make a positive impact on both the environment and local communities.\n\nIntroduction:\nOur project aims to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania, with a focus on waste regeneration and blockchain integration. By combining innovative waste management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\n\nProblem Statement:\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of a waste regeneration system that transforms waste materials into valuable resources. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants.\n- Community Engagement: Raise awareness about waste-related issues and involve local communities in waste management and regeneration efforts as well as how they can benefit from sustainable practices in the form of carbon credits, tokenizing of Real world Assets and much more.\n\n\nWe are looking to revive the machinery at our incubated site to increase capacity and production of these eco-products such as eco-spare parts for Rickcshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which will help add additionality to our project to enable it to receive quality carbon credits which will eventually raise the basic income of our waste pickers from a mere 0.1$ per kilogram of plastic waste.\n\nExamples of our eco products include eco-spare parts for Rickshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which are massively needed to support local Tanzanians and their small businesses. \n\n\n\nThe Team:\n\nOur team consists of dedicated individuals with diverse expertise:\n- David Machuche from Chatafisha, Project Lead: A professional with deep knowledge of local ecological challenges, Regenerative Finance, financial inclusion and Web3 for real world use cases. \n- Victor Muhagachi from Chatafisha, Strategy and Web3 for local communities: An experienced strategy designer, blockchain developer specializing in onboarding local communities to Web3 in broken down Swahili terminologies.\n- Eng. Allen from Zaidi Recyclers Kimambo, Environmental Scientist: A waste management expert with over 10 years experience and a background in sustainable development.\n- Teresia Mhaiki Community Outreach Coordinator: A communication specialist focusing on community engagement, specifically in environment and sustainability.\n\nBudget:\n- Technology Development: $10,000 for decentralized app that will contain sub wallets for waste pickers, track credit scores with blockchain integration.\n- Infrastructure & Plant: $20,000 for setting up waste regeneration facilities and community engagement centers.\n- Logistics for waste: $2,000 for reallocating the waste from collection points to recyclers.\n- Awareness Campaign & Events: $2,000 for educational workshops, awareness programs, and community training.\n\nCall to Action:\nWe invite you to contribute to our mission of creating a more regenerative and sustainable future in Tanzania. By supporting our project, you will play a crucial role in addressing waste management challenges, promoting eco-friendly practices, and fostering transparent financial systems. Your donation will have a lasting positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the overall well-being of the region. Together, we can drive meaningful change and lead the way towards a more sustainable and prosperous Tanzania!\n\nOur address is 0x037Eb04AD9DDFf984F44Ce5941D14b8Ea3781459\n\nImage link for the process on how it will work: https://postimg.cc/KRwMn9Sx",

          "description": "# Our Vision: Raise awareness of stakeholders on ESG and carbon neutrality through Regenerative Finance and web3 technology.\n\nOur vision for ReFi Hong Kong is to create a transformative paradigm that merges environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles with cutting-edge web3 technology. By doing so, we aim to raise awareness among stakeholders about the importance of ESG factors and carbon neutrality, ultimately fostering a regenerative economy that prioritizes sustainability and positive impact.\n\nConsidering our main focus is raising awareness, we believe that by leveraging ReFi and web3 technology, we can effectively educate stakeholders about ESG principles and carbon neutrality, make ESG strategy easier and more attractive. Through innovative financial mechanisms and web3, we will empower and incentivize individuals, businesses, and organizations to understand and actively participate in sustainable practices. By highlighting the interconnectedness between financial decisions and the environment, society, and governance, we can foster a mindset shift towards regenerative approaches.\n\nThus, emphasizing on transformative potential of ReFi, by harnessing the power of web3 technology, we envision a financial ecosystem that promotes transparency, traceability, and accountability. Through these mechanisms, we aim to catalyze the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy in Hong Kong, where businesses and individuals actively contribute to the regeneration of natural resources and the enhancement of social well-being.\n\n# Our Mission:\n\nBased on the innovation of Web3 in technical and financial field, the ReFi DAO HONG KONG could help various stakeholders (government, WEB3 enthusiast, financial institutions and family offices and etc.) included but not limited:\n- To achieve their own carbon neutrality, and to implement innovative methods to practise the CONCEPT of NET ZERO.\n- To explore opportunities on ESG, green and sustainable finance field\n- To wake up public awareness of ESG\n- To accelerate the youth-led education in web3 and regenerative-oriented field.\n\n# Background: The Opportunity in Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong's government has recently taken a proactive stance in supporting the growth of the crypto and Web3 industries by creating a safe space for companies to operate. \n\nThe government has launched a new policy initiative called \"Hong Kong: Asia's World City for Crypto & Blockchain,\" which aims to promote the city as a leading hub for these technologies. This initiative will provide a regulatory framework that balances innovation and investor protection, fostering a stable and safe environment for companies to operate.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is also showing a strong commitment to ESG. In 2019, the government launched the Green Finance Certification Scheme, which encourages financial institutions to develop green finance products and services, and provides certification to those that meet certain criteria. The government has also set a target of reducing Hong Kong's carbon intensity by 65-70% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and has implemented various policies and initiatives to promote renewable energy and efficiency. In addition, Hong Kong has been a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment since 2016, and the government has recently launched a new initiative to promote sustainable finance in the city.\n\n# Challenges From ESG to ReFi\n\nReFi is the next evolution of ESG. Rather than simply reducing harm, ReFi aims to support regenerative practices that restore and improve ecosystems and communities. Additionally, finance instruments can empower regenerative solutions with efficiency and scalability. \n\nStill, lack of self-awareness among individuals and communities regarding the value of ReFi is the key challenges for the Hong Kong local node. The society is in the early stages of seeing a thriving regeneration and web3 ecosystem emerge, and local communities are skeptical about how effective ReFi could be in tackling climate challenge. We cooperate with several initiatives such as Carbonbase, Arkreen, BTC Club and interact proactively with local investment communities. These initiatives offer a solid foundation for the ReFi Hong Kong community to build upon and create a network of like-minded individuals and organizations committed to regenerative finance and sustainable investment. \n\nAlthough the prospects of ReFi in HongKong is bright and brilliant, the path is hard and tortuous. We are facing some realistic challenges. Convincing the highly discerning communities that are raised in an international and developed society is not an easy job, we need to keep constant visiting, impressing them with detailed cases and work, such as arranging high-quality roundtable meetings, exhibitions and other activities. All these brings financial callenges for us and we wholeheartedly appreciate the granting from government, academia and of course, the web3 community like you.\n\n# Action: 1st Online Twitter Space Talk:\n\n27th July 2023, ReFi Hong Kong organized the 1st online Twitter Space Talk. Hosting by ReFi Hong Kong contributor, we invited 4 speakers from different industry (Carbon World, RGRT, New Energy Nexus & Allinfra) to share their exploration and practice of ESG and ReFi in Hong Kong.\n\n![ ReFi Hong Kong organized the 1st online Twitter Space Talk]( https://cdn.discordapp.com/ephemeral-attachments/1092492867185950852/1140845568046932008/Online_Twitter_Space_Talk.png)\n\n# We intend to raise: 5,000 USD that will be well spent to generate the following ambitious outcomes by the end of 2023:\n\n# Your donations will help make this all possible! \n\n## 1. *Engage the local community: 2,000 USD*\n- Host Twitter Space Talks \n- Host at least 2 offline events in H2 2023. (Meetup is always the most effective way to gathering people together to DO something SPECIAL:).) \n- These events will invite expert/guest speakers in ReFi, Web3, and ESG in Hong Kong.\n- The cost may used in venue rental and refreshment arrangement. \n\n## 2. *Education is essential to building a regenerative future. 2,000 USD*\n- Partner with universities to do some projects together.\n- Arrange workshops/seminars to educate young generation on ESG and ReFi\n- The cost may used in venue rental and refreshment arrangement. \n\n## 3. *Promotion and advertisement: 500 USD*\n- To promote the event like create posters, banners, and etc.\n\n## 4. *Human resources: 500 USD*\n- Core team members need to be meetups regularly to discuss the coming activities organization \n- Host monthly meetings on the third Tuesday of every month, to align with all the contributors what we have done and what we will do.\n\n# Impact by the end of 2023\n\nIdeally, we would like to increase the members of ReFi Hong Kong from 33 to 100 in telegram. Reach the followers from 89 to 150 in Twitter. Through organizing offline events, to involve more young people from university into the community.\n \n# Who we are!\n\n## - We are a group of founders, builders, contributors, climate activists, ESG practitioners, engineers...\n## - We are a community of people who are crazy about ESG and ReFi. \n## - All of us are volunteers, joining in ReFi DAO Hong Kong to make a contribution on regenerate our earth.\n## - We firmly believe that although the power of an individual is small, the power of a group of people is unlimited.",

          "title": "Empowering Regenerative Entrepreneurship in Altos Mirandinos",
          "description": "We aim to democratize regenerative entrepreneurship in Altos Mirandinos through education, networking, and technological empowerment. By leveraging blockchain technology and the ReFi framework, the project seeks to unite local producers, farmers, and entrepreneurs to create sustainable economic opportunities and promote positive social change.\n\n**Welcome to the Venezuela ReFi Node efforts, welcome to regeneration**\n\nLos Altos Mirandinos, a vibrant hub with diverse industries and unique challenges, stands next to the capital of Venezuela. Despite hyperinflation and complex market conditions, the city possesses immense entrepreneurial potential. This project's goal is to harness this potential by creating a regenerative ecosystem through education, networking, and blockchain-powered innovation.\n\n**The Role of Twist Studio Creativo:**\nTwist Studio Creativo, a pioneering community center, will spearhead this project. We believe that regenerative entrepreneurship is the way forward for Venezuela, focusing on sustainability, social impact, and equitable economic growth. Our extensive network of entrepreneurs and professionals will serve as a catalyst for meaningful change.\n\n**Refi Spring Grant and Bootcamp:**\nHaving received the Refi Spring Grant, we initiated the ReFi Bootcamp – a cornerstone event that educates local producers, entrepreneurs, and farmers about blockchain, sustainability, and regenerative business models. This bootcamp introduced participants to the transformative power of Web3 technology. These same people will be the first to benefit from this project and become multipliers of the ReFi movement. \n\nThe Problem and Solution:\nVenezuela’s diverse landscape houses both global corporations and sprawling slums. We aim to bridge this gap through education, networking, and technological integration. By using blockchain, we democratize access to data, fostering collaboration and equitable AI development. Our project focuses on regenerative entrepreneurship as an alternative path to economic growth, mitigating hyper-consumerism and revitalizing sustainable practices.\n\n**The Project's Goal:**\nOur primary objective is to unite local producers, farmers, and entrepreneurs with regenerative insights and experiences to create a certification of single-origin and coffee quality. Through education and mentorship, we aim to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to build sustainable businesses.\n\n**How will we do it?**\n\nWe count on a strong community that has already been onboarded on ReFi and is committed to the mission. Among these we have the brothers Barrios, third generation of coffee growing in the region, and Jannina Pójan leader of the International Women’s Coffee Alliance (IWCA), also known as @thecoffeeteacher. Using their leverage with a larger community of more than 150 producers we will multiply our previous work with the ReFi Bootcamp and continue to grow as a large ReFi community. \n\nOur first milestone will be to organize a series of different onboarding activities to make each of these members actively engage in Web3 and ReFi. \n\nAlso among our community leaders, we have Osiris Ostia @Biosirisnatural an activist agriculture engineer that works to bring a more sustainable approach to the region with Mr Apolinares, a descendant of natives who proudly brings real empirical experience on how to restore our ecosystems. They will be in charge of the field training to provide fundamental applicable tools to our producers. \n\nFinally, we will utilize collected data and standardized procedures to create our first NFTs and recognition to the community. Their final product (Coffee and products) will be accompanied by digital proof of their impact and sustainable methods. \n\nFor the development of on-chain reputation certificates with NFTs and the trust-building process with the Web3 and Sustainability communities, we count on our friends of TrustedSeed and our local organizations as Corporation B Venezuela. \n\n**The Team:**\n\n**Susana González:** An adept storyteller and networker, dedicated to Web3 sustainability at ImpactScope. With a background in fostering relationships in the entrepreneurship community, Susana brings an innovative perspective.\n\n\n**Daniel Alejandro Knobelsdorf:** Founder of Transience Labs and a key player in Ethereum Venezuela, SingularityU Caracas, and more. Daniel brings a wealth of experience in blockchain technology and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n**María Fernanda Cordova:** A community builder and Ed-tech advocate, María champions innovative education initiatives. Her expertise in leadership and social impact is a valuable asset.\n\n**Budget:**\n\n- Training (Bootcamps, mentoring sessions): $3,000\n- Field training: $2,000\n- Development of on-chain reputation certificate with NFTs  $1,000\n- Incentives as microcredit: $1,000\n\nWe invite you to be a part of this transformative journey by contributing to our grant. Your support will enable us to empower local entrepreneurs, create sustainable opportunities, and foster positive change in Venezuela. \n\n \"Those who are entrepreneurs in Venezuela are seeking to regenerate it.\" Hence, the ReFi business model naturally aligns with the country's current needs. Venezuela, a nation in need of regeneration, stands to gain numerous benefits from ReFi, as do other countries facing similar circumstances.\n\n\n**Donate Today to Empower Regenerative Entrepreneurship in Los Altos Mirandinos!**",

          "title": "ReFi London — Convening Leaders of Change.",
          "description": "### **Overview**\n\nAt the crossroads of entrepreneurship, finance, and world-leading institutions lies London— a city teeming with talent, capital, and a history of leading change. Against this backdrop, ReFi London is emerging with a clear purpose: to bring together the city's unparalleled strengths and channel them towards building a sustainable, regenerative future.\n\nWith your support, this grant will be the seed from which we build this community. We will offer events & meetups for leaders to converge, develop a comprehensive map of local regenerative projects, and support Regens Unite London. Together, we will make London a leading light in the global regenerative economy movement.\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe roots of ReFi London are embedded in the global ambition of ReFi DAO—a vision to cultivate a worldwide regenerative economy through a network of interconnected local communities known as ‘Local Nodes’. ReFi London aspires to be a beacon among these Nodes, rallying high-impact leaders and leveraging London's leadership in finance, entrepreneurship, technology, and academia for positive change.\n\n### **Key Activities Supported by this Grant:**\n\n**35% - Support for Regens Unite London:** Bolster the efforts of Regens Unite London by providing financial sponsorship and active participation to further our shared missions of uniting the regenerators of London. This will serve as the kickoff for ReFi London with a collaborative workshop to convene stakeholders in co-creating this new organisation.\n\n**25 % -** **ReFi London Knowledge Graph & Website:** Fuel the development of the ReFi London Knowledge Graph and the accompanying website. This platform will serve as a comprehensive map of London's regenerative economy ecosystem and local projects. It will empower members with the data, connections, and insights they need to catalyze meaningful change and serve as a key first step for going on to actively support local regenerative initiatives (e.g. community/city farms, local cooperatives, re-wilding initiatives etc..)\n\n**40% - ReFi London Summit & Events Fund**: Half of the grant will be channelled towards an Events Fund in preparation for the ReFi London Summit and other upcoming events. Recognizing London's unparalleled position as a hub of talent and innovation, these events aim to attract the best of the public, private, and third-sector leaders beyond the immediate bubble of Web3 & ReFi. With your support, we can ensure these events reach their full potential, making them the cornerstone of our community-building efforts, networking opportunities, and knowledge exchange with policymakers and think tanks.\n\nThrough the allocation of the grant's funds to these core activities, we are poised to set in motion a transformative wave of initiatives that fortify London's position as a pioneer in regenerative finance and sustainable practices. Every penny will be used judiciously, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed our objectives in making London a leading light in the global regenerative economy movement.\n\n### **Join Us!**\n\nReFi London is a call to leaders, innovators, and changemakers to step forward and coalesce their efforts towards a common goal: a regenerative future. In this era of unprecedented challenges, the solution lies in unity, collaboration, and a shared vision. Support ReFi London, be part of the revolution, and let's together sculpt the regenerative economy of tomorrow 🌱\n\n[![Social-Media-Header-3-A-Warm.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtYJ2CxR/Social-Media-Header-3-A-Warm.png)](https://postimg.cc/dkdCdqCB)",

          "description": "### Tulum’s Tomorrow: Accelerating the Regenaissance with ReFi Tulum\n\nReFi Tulum is an instrumental force driving positive change for Mexico and the world, embracing the two key pillars of **circular economies** and **regenerative tourism** to shape a sustainable, equitable future for generations to come. Our vision focuses on innovation, community engagement, women's empowerment, and impactful storytelling to ignite the \"Regenaissance.\"\n\n\n[![tulumbeach.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/0Qh8Xct0/tulumbeach.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/KkrSRrh1)\n## Why Circularity and Tourism?\n\nThe world is at a pivotal point, demanding a paradigm shift towards circular economies and regenerative practices. Tulum, with its pristine beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant culture, has captured the hearts of travelers, digital nomads, and expats from around the globe. However, its popularity has come at a cost; the growth of the population and influx of millions of visitors have put a strain on its fragile ecosystems, infrastructure, and cultural heritage.\n\nTulum's allure is deeply rooted in its natural beauty and rich heritage. By adopting circular economies and regenerative tourism, we're not only preserving these unique attributes but enhancing them. Our innovative initiatives bring together tourists, local communities, and businesses in a collective effort to restore and protect Tulum's environment. This approach goes beyond sustainability; it ensures Tulum thrives for generations to come.\n\n### Circular Economies through Innovation: Technology and Incentivization\n\nWith our core partner, [Petgas](https://www.petgas.com.mx/), we're leading the charge in the de-plastification of the planet, leveraging existing technology solutions to address a lack of waste disposal options especially prevalent in Mexico, as well as impacting humanity around the world. Our mission is clear: to embrace circular economies and regenerative tourism as pivotal strategies that will shape a sustainable and equitable future for generations to come.\n\n**Plastic pollution is a global crisis**, and ReFi Tulum is committed to addressing it head-on. Here's how we're tackling this critical issue through **Web3 incentivization, Education, and Innovation**:\n\n- **Web3 Incentivization**: We're harnessing the power of blockchain tech and Web3 to incentivize and reward individuals for their active participation and “mining” of plastic waste from the environment.\n  - Through a measurement and rewards system powered by a mobile app, we want to change the way people, both tourists and locals, see plastic, from a waste into a resource. They will see their wallets gain tokens with each plastic drop-off and successful plastic weigh-in.\n  - We plan to use NFTs to fund investments in plants, machinery, measurement, and logistics to start the circular flow of waste to sellable products and passive income streams for holders. NFTs can be used in a multitude of ways from plastic traceability and measurement to rewards for actions such as POAPs, and many types of membership structures that provide access to machinery and other benefits.\n\n[![jaguarplasticbeach.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/g22K4D17/jaguarplasticbeach.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8RswqvQ)\n\n-**Education** ReFi Tulum is deeply committed to fostering education and awareness as cornerstones of our mission. We intend to cultivate a learning ecosystem that spans various dimensions of sustainability, regenerative practices, and plastic waste management. Through workshops, training sessions, and engaging experiences, we will empower local communities, tourists, and children with knowledge about responsible plastic use, circular economies, and the significance of the Blue Circular Economy. \n\n- **Innovation - Thermoformation for New Products:** Through thermoformation technology, ReFi Tulum plans to transform plastic into a variety of usable resellable products, from furniture and building materials to plastic collection bins. This process not only addresses plastic waste but also supports our self-sustainability, as the repurposed plastic contributes to our operations and initiatives.\n[![tf100.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/50XvD9Jd/tf100.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/XG0pCbXQ)\n\n- **Measurement**\nIn our commitment to tackle plastic pollution, we have implemented a beginner system of measurement and traceability. For instance, each plastic jaguar collector, when filled, holds 12 kg of plastic waste. At the National Beach jaguar zone, the placement of 3 of these collectors results in the collection of 36 kg every 5 days. This cumulative effort, amounting to 180 kg per month, effectively neutralizes significant amounts of plastic waste. This measurement and traceability approach ensures the tangible impact of our initiatives in combating plastic pollution.\n\n[![tracking.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KjDSKFkG/tracking.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/kRGhZ0vz)\nThrough these innovative strategies and collaborations, we can lead the charge in deplastifying the planet. By leveraging technology and aligning incentive structures, we can turn the tide against plastic pollution, and showcase that success to inspire others around the world.\n\n## Regenerative Tourism Movement to Clean, Restore, and Transform\n\nThe **ReFi Tulum Regenerative Tourism** initiative aims to reimagine Tulum's tourism industry by shifting from a focus on sustainability to regenerative practices. By engaging tourists, businesses, and local communities, we aspire to create a thriving and resilient destination that preserves and enhances Tulum's natural and cultural heritage for generations to come. We believe Tulum and the surrounding area offer the right and necessary conditions to be a successful model to the world of how to regeneratively develop a tourism industry that not only mitigates its negative impacts but actively contributes to the restoration, preservation, and thriving of both the natural environment and local communities, setting a powerful example for global destinations seeking a more responsible and regenerative approach to tourism.\n\nTulum's Riviera, known for its exquisite natural splendor, ancestral heritage, and magnetic allure, serves as the canvas to illustrate tales of regeneration. These experiential narratives not only profoundly impact travelers but also leave enduring, regenerative imprints on the very places they explore. We want to shift tourism from exploitative to one of rejuvenation, all while targeting the critical global issue of plastic waste.\n[![milagros.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6QDLWNTs/milagros.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/67fGcgdz)\n## Our Vision: Immersive Regenerative Experiences\n\nOur goal is to develop immersive and educational experiences that provide visitors with an opportunity to actively participate in regenerative activities such as beach cleanups, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable agriculture. This will also provide an opportunity to showcase local Mexican projects to the world for greater visibility, growth, and project acceleration. Using regenerative tourism to create a collective effort to regenerate and protect Tulum's ecosystem.\n\n### Experiences\n\nEngage in IRL (in real life) utility of web3 planet positive collections such as the House of Panther, Restore Coral, CocoCoin.club, Entre Monedas, Maya Spirits, Crypto Papaya, and many others in regenerative land cultivation and other ReFi companies that are using web3 to accelerate positive change. We will develop experiences as well as a 7 or 8-day road trip that visits the best examples of ReFi in the area.\n\n### Collaborative Restoration\n\nWork with local groups and government agencies to develop scalable mangrove planting and jungle restoration operations and attract global organizations for large scale planting activities.\n[![siankaanmangrove.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/25MFkL28/siankaanmangrove.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/XZKyxJRT)\n\n**SolarPunk Electric Scooter Private Beach Experience** is the first a la carte regenerative tourism experience that can be purchased with crypto and takes visitors on an unforgettable journey along Tulum's Mayan Jaguar Road, with a stop at the breathtaking archeological ruins while engaging in regenerative practices and ending at a private beach for self regeneration and ocean healing.\n[![sandrascootersolarpunk.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Vkyx64L2/sandrascootersolarpunk.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/fJK2qcdv)\n\n## Community Engagement\n\n-**ReFi Web3 Women** gatherings take place once a month at the NFT Boutique. These gatherings cover and educate on topics such as What is ReFi, quadratic funding, and DAOs. The aim is to inform and empower women to join the ReFi movement and share their insights with their communities.\n[![2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zGf93z2X/2.png)](https://postimg.cc/Vd37V8c3)\n[![web3women.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/4dBK4m6F/web3women.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/gXLcNcBv)\n- Development of art and functional works with children made from plastic, as well as artworks turned into NFTs.\n- Collaborate with indigenous leaders and businesses to develop web3 educational programs that resonate with the community.\n- Creation of workshops and training sessions for children’s web3 education and parent onboarding in parallel to helping children.\n[![ashanti.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6pH7r72V/ashanti.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HrysHktj)\n\n## Use of Funds\nThe allocation of funds will play a pivotal role in advancing our mission. Specifically, a substantial portion of the funds raised will be directed towards the acquisition of the TF100 machine, a cutting-edge technology that holds the key to transforming plastic waste into valuable resources. This crucial step will mark the initiation of our blue circular economy, where repurposed plastic will be utilized in the creation of functional and sustainable products. By investing in the TF100 machine, we are laying the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem that not only combats plastic pollution but also generates revenue to fuel our regenerative initiatives.\n\nTo supplement these costs, we are embracing the innovative power of NFTs  Through strategic NFT offerings, we aim to not only raise additional funds but also engage our community in a unique and rewarding way. NFTs will serve as more than just digital assets; they will be a symbol of collective action, allowing supporters to have a tangible stake in our circular economy journey and allow holders to take part in sales from the new economy outputs. This fusion of cutting-edge technology and community engagement will drive the financial sustainability of our initiatives and amplify their impact. Your support will directly contribute to jumpstarting this transformative cycle of environmental restoration and economic empowerment, made possible through Gitcoin Grant quadratic funding.\n\nReFi Tulum stands as a potent catalyst for transformative change, not only in Mexico but across the globe. Rooted in the pillars of circular economies and regenerative tourism, our mission is a resounding call to action, forging a path towards a sustainable and equitable future for generations to come. A vision fueled by innovation, community empowerment, women's agency, and impactful storytelling ignites what we proudly term the \"Regenaissance.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "Our project aims to revolutionize climate education and sustainable farming practices within rural farm communities in Nigeria, by harnessing the power of Web3 technology. As these communities face increasing challenges posed by climate change, we recognize the pressing need to empower local farmers with knowledge, tools, and resources to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.\n\nThrough strategic collaboration and Web3 events, we will create a dynamic ecosystem that connects indigenous knowledge with cutting-edge climate science, fostering a resilient and informed farming community. Key components of our initiative and impacts include:\n\nLocalized Learning: Our platform will offer context-specific content, integrating indigenous knowledge and traditional practices with the latest advancements in climate science, tailored to the unique challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Nigeria.\n\nInteractive Workshops: Virtual workshops and simulations will provide farmers with hands-on experience in implementing sustainable farming techniques, encouraging experimentation and innovation.\n\nPeer Collaboration: Decentralized discussion forums will facilitate collaboration among farmers, enabling the sharing of experiences, best practices, and local insights.\n\nBlockchain-Backed Rewards: Farmers actively engaged in learning and implementing sustainable practices will be rewarded with blockchain-based tokens, incentivizing active participation and knowledge sharing.\n\nBy merging Web3 technology with climate education, our project envisions a future where rural farm communities in Lagos achieve climate resilience, food security, and economic prosperity. By empowering local farmers with knowledge and tools, we aspire to create a sustainable and vibrant agricultural sector that not only adapts to climate change but also leads the way in sustainable practices for the region.\n",

We try to build a label-rich user portrait system, which is based on on-chain and off-chain data analysis and data mining, infer user identity through algorithms models and offers the final user identify evaluation service.\n\n# Why we build Inferer?\n\n1. We're still in a early stage of crypto development, and user environment is under chaos in some way. There're so many bots around which hurts user experience, so    many security accidents occurred in these days which stopped more users from getting engaged with crypto. Hence, we hope we could build a service which identifies the users through the behaviors behind the address. We would need to use the benefits from the immutable data on chain and do lots of data analysis and data mining to achieve that goal. On the other hand, we would also like to offer great products which facilitate end users to have a much more convenient way to check the identity of the account address. In this way, we hope it could increase the cost of bot activities and raise the bar when they try to hurt others, which we hope would improve the user environment ultimately.\n\n2. The data infra system and user label system we built in the above process could also help serve in SocialFi projects and Risk Control in fund transfer on chain.\n\n# What's our vision?\n\nWe believe the value of data analysis and data mining would grow very quickly when data on chain explodes. And Inferer would like to start from users' perspective and build more great products to form a web3 user identity platform, which we hope could help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.\n\n# What we're currently building?\n\nWe're currently focused on building a user identity analysis product, which hope to facilitate crypto users to have a convenient user identity check and reduce the bot activities. This'll start from a nice tool for crypto users to improve their efficiency at the beginning. We hope we could help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain in the end.\n\n![](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/daa44d9a3796d1bd8da62885e95c407b/intro.png)\n\nWe believe COMMUNITY matters a lot in Inferer. And we're trying to build our community which Inferer belongs to. Anyone who's interested is greatly welcome.\n\n# Update\n\n2023/7/29:\n\n1: We're excited to announce that Inferer officially supports Inferer Ranking on website https://ranking.inferer.xyz. It offers great product quality with concise on-chain data analysis! Brand new product user experience, new design interface, more advanced data analysis, we're offering a high level product and we're pretty proud of it. Again, we're committed to keep improving Inferer Ranking and believe it would bring huge impact in crypto project analysis.\n\n2: We have another great product Inferer Identity is on the way to get online as well (expected late Aug early Sep). That's also amazing! If would introduce a great scoring system for crypto users and provide great values for projects to check their target users avatars. Please give us a little bit time to build it to a great quality and we have confidence that it would surprise you.\n\n3: Recently we're discussing a lot on future airdrop product and have a great finding on this. We're having a demo to verify the concept. We do believe it would be a thing to crypto community.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F2WVefob0AAHIFS?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n2023/4/7:\n\n1: For Inferer community gitcoin members, we're back! Back here to report our progress regularly, and brings with an amazing new product - Inferer Ranking.\n\n2: We're excited to announce that Inferer could not only support the on-chain user address identity analysis, but also for on-chain contract web3 projects (especially NFT project). This would be obviously a tremendous scope improvement for Inferer. We hope not only we could provide users efficient identity look up tool (compared with checking transactions in etherscan or polygonscan), but also we could provide a brand new & efficient way helping users checking projects(especially NFT) users' group portraits, which could be a great reference for new users to check whether a project is with good quality or just a scam project to rug pull. We believe some new crypto users would need this and we treat this in a very valuable way!\n\n3: We love Reddit! Not only their avatar nft users grow exponentially from 3m to 10m, but also for the unbelievably great crypto-friendly culture. We enjoy quite a lot in having discussions in Reddit. And it helped us to determine our first project analysis landing on Reddit Avatar Collections. It's quite valuable for us to analyze all avartar through, which gives us a very clear concept that which avartar series is now trending and which nft now leads in profits. We believe this would be quite useful for those reddit avatar traded users. In the long run, we're going to cover many more projects and willing to bring great values for crypto users. We believe this would definetly bring great values to crypto and help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/af7660b3640f3eda4fdbda801bc733e7/Frame_1321314535.png)\n\n2023/02/16:\n\n1: We're excited to announce officially that Inferer now has a brand new official site https://www.inferer.xyz. It brings totally new design language and much better user experience. This new version shows great product level in Inferer. We believe that you all would love it.\n\n\n2: We brought a great internal engineering product here: Inferer label backend system. In order to reach unbelievably lots of labels, we need to improve our label processing efficiency, in a massive improvement way. In detail, it needs to handle label creation, label deletion, label edit, label check, label daily update, label comparison, label degrees and many more label related operations, all in a user friendly way with great efficiency. This leads to our new coming amazing product: Inferer label backend system, which aimed to cover these requirements and take overall label processing efficiency to a much higher level. Inferer label system has come to v1.0 and been put into use NOW. It would also iterate very quickly. We're very passionate to polish this tool to help Inferer reach to next stage.\n\n\n3: We're excited to announce that AWS has decided to help fund in Inferer! We had amazing conversations and had a very great consensus: Inferer is a great project and would like to see the achievements that Inferer would take in the future. That would be a very interesting thing that we both believed.\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/e9eba657ae1339a539a38cc6040c0b15/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2023-01-31_%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%884.11.36.png)\n\n2022/11/28:\n\n\n1. We're excited to announce that Inferer Search has been renamed to Inferer Identity.\n\n\n2. Inferer Identity has updated to v0.0.13. In this version, we included a major new feature: Inferer Label, which would be the key to our future user identity analysis service. Inferer Label would serve directly into our user portrait system and become the data basis in our evaluation algorithms. We would increase lots of labels to help us reach the precise analysis result.\n\n\n3. For Inferer Label, not only we're adding more & more labels, we also try to dig more interesting dimensions on labels. We add 'degree' metric to Inferer Label, such as \"Big Ens User\", which refers to users who adopted more than 5 Ens names on their account or \"Ens Collector\", which refers to users who adopted more than 30 Ens names on their account, this extend info would help a lot in figuring out user's motive or interest. We're excited to see the benefit this brings to our evaluation process.\n\n\n4. On engineering, we want to reach the point that Inferer Internal System could label new qualified users day by day, automatically. And we have covered this NOW.\n\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/b5d062a0df2ffc2553710c2fd10c90f5/Frame_45.png)\n\n\n2022/10/22:\n\n-   Inferer Search has updated to v0.0.10. We put quite much time on many details which we believe would improve users' experience in a long time. Some of them listed:\n\n\n    1. always focus on the address edit text which could help users to replace new address, and avoid delete address one by one\n\n\n    2. fix that some users can't launch \"Inferer Search\" through mouse' right click \"Inferer 0x*****\" after they sleep the computer\n\n\n    3. add more twitter KOLs in Recommend feature, which facilitate users' check on these KOLs' identity\n\n\n    4. add more hackers info in Warning feature, which we hope could help keep users from scams\n\n\n    5. integrate internal server APIs to optimize the JSON API response time\n\n\n    6. add support for users to switch their binding address to inferer account\n\n\n2022/09/28:\n\n\nWe officially launched our Inferer Search product in chrome store now. Check it out https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inferer/cihpoafnmmlancocngfdmdcfhkfjglnj. DM us anything on Twitter(https://twitter.com/inferer_xyz).

          "description": "Proposal: ReFi Local Node - Pindamonhangaba\n\nOur ReFi Local Node project in Pindamonhangaba seeks to bridge the gap between sustainable practices, holistic well-being, and the emerging world of Web3 technologies. Through a series of engaging and diverse events, both in-person and online, we aim to reconnect individuals with nature, foster community collaboration, and provide educational content in Portuguese about Web3 and decentralized finance. Our initiative will include curated photography exhibitions, immersive agroforestry experiences, and online onboarding sessions. By combining art, nature, and technology, we strive to inspire regenerative action in our local community while supporting the global movement towards a more sustainable future.\n\n1.\tIntroduction to the Project: The ReFi Local Node project in Pindamonhangaba is dedicated to fostering a sense of interconnectedness between nature, sustainable living, and the Web3 movement. Our vision is to create an inclusive space where individuals can engage with both the physical environment and the virtual world, ultimately contributing to a more regenerative and harmonious future.\n\n2.\tProblem and Solution: Nurturing a connection with nature and harnessing the untapped potential of Web3 technologies for advancing sustainable practices remains a challenge in our community. Through a series of engaging events, we intend to bridge this gap. By combining hands-on experiences with digital platforms, we aim to create a holistic understanding of how technology and nature can coexist to address real-world challenges.\n\n3.\tProject Goals: Our primary goal is to reconnect people with nature and empower them with knowledge about sustainable practices and emerging technologies. We envision building a community that actively participates in reforestation initiatives, agroforestry workshops, and Web3 education. By fostering this synergy, we aspire to promote positive changes in individual behaviors, communal relationships, and environmental awareness.\n\n4.\tTeam Presentation: Our team consists of passionate individuals deeply committed to sustainable living and technology. Jorge, Deroila, and Cauê bring diverse expertise in sustainability, community engagement, and tech education. We are further supported by partnerships with NFTreesBrasil and Diogo from @agroforestDAO, enriching our efforts with their valuable insights and experiences.\n\n5.\tImpact Measurement: We believe in quantifying our impact through tangible metrics. Attendee participation, post-event surveys, and engagement rates on social media platforms will help us gauge the success of our initiatives. Additionally, we will collect narratives of changed behaviors and testimonies from participants, reflecting the positive influence our events have on their daily lives.\n\nWe're committed to transparently measuring our impact and sharing our progress. In addition to traditional methods, we're exploring innovative ways to showcase event outcomes, including the possibility of using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent tangible evidence of positive changes. These NFTs could capture transformed spaces, participant testimonials, and online collaborations, providing a more engaging way for the community to see the results of their involvement. This aligns with Web3 principles and enhances our mission of promoting sustainability and Web3 awareness. The NFT concept is in exploration, and your support will help us refine this approach, adding a unique layer of engagement and accountability.\nHow You Can Make a Difference:\nBy contributing to the ReFi Local Node - Pindamonhangaba, you are directly supporting:\n\n• Experiential Activities (Palestras, workshops, and field-based activities): Join us in hosting thought-provoking discussions, skill-building workshops, and hands-on field activities that bring sustainable practices to life.

Creating regenerative systems is not simply a technical, economic, ecological or social shift: it has to go hand-in-hand with an underlying shift in the way we think about ourselves, **our relationships with each other and with life as a whole.**\n\nReFi Barcelona idea is to be aligned with Commons principles by promoting shared ownership, community engagement, and decentralized decision-making for sustainable resource management.\n\n## Barcelona 🌞\n\nBarcelona is the biggest (entirely) European city in the Mediterranean sea. The city, and Catalonia in general, has a rich history and actuality of support to progressive initiatives. \n\nBarcelona, as a densely populated urban center, faces a unique set of challenges stemming from its status as a bustling metropolis and the impacts of over-tourism. The city's social fabric has undergone transformations due to increased tourism, which has at times strained local resources and community cohesion. Furthermore, the depletion of natural resources, coupled with recurrent droughts exacerbated by rising temperatures due to climate change, has compounded these issues.\n\nThere is a growing web3 ecosystem in the area with deep roots in the history of web3.\n\n### Appetite for Regeneration 🧑‍🌾\n\nPublic institutions such as the Ajuntament de Barcelona (city council) has had a big focus on positive social & ecological change, with active initiatives addressing urban regeneration, waste management and climate change - being reference in many of these. Government and institutional support for sustainability projects is notable, creating a conducive environment for local initiatives. The city is known for its innovative character and is home to numerous entrepreneurial ventures and investment activities that can be aligned with regenerative principles.\n\n## ReFi Barcelona Gènesis 🌱\n\n![ReFi_BCN_Kickoff](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F1z0YbgWIAETCCQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\nOn the 20th of July ReFi Barcelona had its Kick-Off event bringing together an initial group of people interested in supporting the strengthening of regeneration and ReFi in Barcelona.\n\nCheck out some more about the event here: https://twitter.com/ReFiBarcelona/status/1683490586018422795\n\n\n**The local node can offer a range of goods and services, including:**\n\n- Regenerative events, workshops, and networking opportunities.\n- Sustainable project incubation and support.\n- Community engagement and citizens' assemblies for shared decision-making.\n- Partnerships with local businesses for collaborative initiatives.\n- Funding opportunities through grants, web3 native fundraising, and partnerships to projects.\n\n\n**ReFi Barcelona plans to secure funding and revenue through various channels, including:**\n\n- Grants from programs like Gitcoin and CLR.fund.\n- Community events, memberships, and sponsorships.\n- Ecosystem grants, such as for Celo's and Optimism's.\n- Collaboration with local initiatives and government support.\n- Exploration of other web3 fundraising mechanisms.\n- Capitalization and tokenization of positive action.\n\n## Team details 🌟\n\nReFi BCN founding team:\n\n- [Luiz Fernando Gomez Segala](https://twitter.com/louizfe)\n- [Justina Svitaite](https://twitter.com/jcukini)\n- [Emanuel Toledo](https://twitter.com/emanuel_tol)\n- [Roger Pan](https://twitter.com/rog3rpan)\n- [Emilia Sierra Guzmán](https://twitter.com/MowgliRegen)",

General awareness campaigns have emerged aimed at the population, but with limited impact.\n\nWe've taken on the challenge of initiating our ReFi community with the idea of making an impact on our region.\n\nHere's what we aim to achieve:\n\n1) Identification of habitats or locations for tree planting.\n2) Trash collection drive.\n3) Engaging with foundations or tourism companies to guide tourists off the traditional tourist path, introducing an alternative tourism plan that allows exploration of different positive aspects of Saravena municipality, such as its rivers, farms (banana, cacao, orange, yucca, etc. cultivation).\n4) Establishing an environmental awareness program in schools, taking students to events focused on cleaning specific areas for tree planting, aiding in river conservation, and creating gardens within educational institutions.\n5) Promoting a shift in the environmental care culture of the Saravena population, starting with the promotion of biodegradable or reusable bags.\n6) Advocating for respect towards indigenous communities and contributing to the preservation of their cultures.",

Our aim is to empower young South Africans to support initiatives that address Cape Town’s most pressing challenges. The core challenges we address are socioeconomic inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to essential resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing and education.\nKindly donate to our grant so we can start our journey of youth-led education for regeneration! With a match funding pool of over $25k thanks to the amazing GitCoin community, Celo and Celo Europe, every single dollar makes a big difference!\nWe intend to raise: 4000USD that will be consciously spent to achieve exponential outcomes:\n\n1. Host monthly community events: These will include expert guest speakers in ReFi, Web3 and urban challenges in African cities. We hope to engage young people from from RLabs, Younglings, and YOMA. We also hope to engage the City of Cape Town, Western Cape Government, Department of Basic Education, Stellenbosch University Centre for Sustainability Transitions, University of Cape Town, African Centre for Cities, ICLEI Africa, UNICEF, and private sector organisations interested in Web3 and sustainability.\n2. Host biannual hackathons: Focus on upskilling young local software developers. Problem statements encourage hackers to build user-friendly and mobile first dApps that address contextual challenges. Collaborate with other platforms who can provide technical support and infrastructure. \n\n3. Host a digital Impacts Marketplace: To use the ixo software stack to develop and host a ReFi Cape Town Impacts Marketplace. The objective of this is to support high-impact social projects in developing digital assets for impact measurement, verification and fundraising.\n",

          "description": "\nWe propose a comprehensive project that integrates tradition, emotion, and technology to foster a vibrant and connected community in Porto, Portugal. Through a multifaceted approach involving events, applications, protocols, and a web3-focused community, we aim to address burnout, nurture creativity, and unite local individuals with the principles of ReFi\n\n\nIn a world enamoured by technological advancement, it is crucial not to overlook the fragility of the human experience. Our project seeks to strike a harmonious balance between technological innovation and human connection. By nurturing inclusivity, collaboration, and cultural heritage, we aspire to build an empowered and united community.\n\nThe unchecked pace of technological evolution often neglects the intricate facets of human existence. The lack of space for empathy and understanding in technological advancements can lead to detachment, burnout, and societal estrangement. Within the heart of Porto, a city rich in history and resilience, the challenges of gentrification, economic disparity, and cultural erosion threaten to erode the city's unique identity. Our project endeavours to tackle these issues head-on by uniting and harvesting the individuals and causes that are already busy with these problems \n\nOur project revolves around an indirect strategy that encompasses somatic practices, immersive events, networking initiatives, and collaborative endeavours, all rooted in the principles of  community, locality and social impact technology. By doing so, we aim to forge a community of locals and web3 enthusiasts,  that employ ( or learn to employ) technology as a conduit for enriching human lives and resolving pressing societal dilemmas.\n\nOur Goals:\nEnhance Well-being: Introduce comprehensive somatic and therapeutic movement programs to combat burnout, stress, and mental fatigue, fostering a robust sense of physical and emotional well-being among community members.\n\nCatalyze Collaboration: Orchestrating an array of events, workshops, and hackathons that amalgamate local talents, artisans, grassroots leaders, and pioneering web3 enterprises, thereby facilitating meaningful interactions, ideation, and groundbreaking problem-solving.\n\nEmpower Microcosmic Communities: By offering infrastructure, resources, and networking platforms, we intend to galvanize artists, artisans, and community managers, enabling them to thrive, contribute, and catalyze local advancement.\n\nCounter Gentrification: In a proactive response to gentrification, our efforts will centre on nurturing local culture, amplifying distinctive talents, and  creating tools that help communities to fight against evictions \n\n\nComprising a dynamic cohort with diverse backgrounds spanning art, community management, production, and technological innovation, our team  is also all Porto Native. Our track record encompasses grassroots initiatives and state-funded projects, all underpinning our unyielding commitment to empowering Porto's thriving community.\n\nEfficient resource allocation is pivotal to actualize our visionary objectives. The budget breakdown will encompass:\nVenue procurement and equipment provisioning for events, workshops, and movement classes\nEngagement of distinguished guest speakers, trainers, and mentors for hackathons and networking sessions\nWeb3 development and aesthetic refinement of apps and protocols\nStrategic marketing and outreach initiatives to seamlessly integrate the community\nAdministrative and operational overhead\nThe establishment of an avant-garde co-working space tailored to accommodate nomadic entities\n\nElevate this transformative project by contributing to its realisation. Your participation will serve as a foundational pillar for cultivating a resilient community, kindling cross-disciplinary collaboration, and fortifying Porto's distinctive cultural narrative. Together, we can co-create a future wherein technology converges harmoniously with humanity.\n",

          "title": "ReFi Guadalajara",
          "description": "ReFi Movement in Guadalajara: Bridging Regeneration \n\nIntroduction: We are at the forefront of a transformative movement in #Guadalajara. Our mission is to create a bridge between finances, technology, academia, public policy, and regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By emphasizing these intersections, we aim to empower Guadalajara's communities to address some of the city's most pressing challenges through workshops, incubation, and investment. These challenges encompass poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to essential resources such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\nProject Explanation: Through this initiative, we aim to deepen the understanding of ReFi in Guadalajara, particularly focusing on regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By doing so, we hope to enhance the environmental and social impact that new ventures can bring to the region. This renewed focus on ReFi projects and understanding will enable us to grow economically without compromising our environment and quality of life. Collaborating closely with ReFiDAO, we aim to onboard more individuals into the ReFi ecosystem, guiding them towards regenerative agricultural practices.\n\nObjective for Funding: Our primary goal is to conduct onboarding activities to increase awareness about the ReFi movement and the importance of transitioning to regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By raising awareness of such projects and technologies, we believe they will align seamlessly with Guadalajara's trend of new technology-based ventures, gradually leading to a surge in ReFi companies in the region with a global footprint.\n\nAim: Our primary objective is to harness the power of open-source data generation, making it accessible to academia, government, and the private sector. This data-centric approach aims to expedite access to mechanisms such as carbon credits, biodiversity credits, and circular credits. These mechanisms, vital for the regeneration movement, heavily rely on data accessibility for verification. By democratizing access to this data, we aspire to foster a collaborative environment where various sectors can work in tandem to address Guadalajara's challenges, emphasizing regenerative agriculture and livestock practices.\n\nBudget: We intend to raise 28,200 USD, which will be strategically allocated to achieve the following ambitious outcomes:\n\nSoil Sampling for Project Baseline: 7,000 USD\nThis will fund comprehensive soil sampling across key agricultural areas in Guadalajara, establishing a baseline for future regenerative efforts and monitoring.\n\nKnowledge-Sharing Workshop on Carbon Sequestration: 4,500 USD\n\nA workshop aimed at sharing knowledge between communities about innovative methods to accelerate carbon sequestration. This will also cover ways to reduce costs on sampling for monitoring and verification using advanced technologies like Neural Networks and Satellite data.\n\nReplicable Model Presentation Workshop: 4,500 USD\nThis workshop will focus on presenting a replicable model for regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. It will serve as a blueprint for producers and stakeholders interested in transitioning to regenerative practices.\n\nInvestment Fund for Local Producers: 10,000 USD\nA dedicated fund to support agave, nopal, berries, and livestock producers. This fund will facilitate their transition to regenerative practices by providing them with tools, resources, and knowledge. It will act as a catalyst, ensuring that local producers have the necessary support to adopt and benefit from regenerative practices.\n\nOperational and Miscellaneous Costs: 2,200 USD\nThese funds will be reserved for any unforeseen expenses, ensuring the smooth execution of all planned activities.\n\nCity Overview: Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, is a unique blend of tradition and innovation. Historically rooted in agriculture and livestock, it has evolved into a tech hub, making it a nexus of technology and agriculture.\nSustainability Movements in Guadalajara:\nSEMADET: A testament to Jalisco's commitment to environmental sustainability, driving sustainable initiatives and policies.\n\nState Program for Climate Change Action: A comprehensive program addressing climate change, emphasizing vulnerability assessments, forest management, and adaptation strategies.\n\nOPD Bosque La Primavera: Dedicated to conserving the La Primavera Flora and Fauna Protection Area, ensuring the preservation of natural resources.\nEntrepreneurial and Investment Activity: Guadalajara is positioning itself as a digital and tech hub, with initiatives like Ciudad Creativa Digital and the Innovation Ministry & Startup Landing Pad.\nAgricultural and Tech Significance: Jalisco's agricultural prominence, especially in tequila production, combined with its tech expertise, offers a holistic approach to sustainable development.\nConservation and Restoration Potential: The Santiago River Basin, despite challenges from pollution and agricultural runoff, presents a unique opportunity for regeneration due to its ecological significance and conservation efforts.\n\nCity’s Needs and Tangible Impact Strategies:\nEnvironmental Awareness and Defense: Strengthening social awareness for environmental assets through community-driven campaigns and technology.\n\nWaste and Water Management: Addressing waste and water challenges through blockchain and industry collaboration.\nMobility and Traffic Management: Improving mobility using data analytics and promoting alternative transportation.\n\nRegenerative Agricultural and Livestock Practices: Transitioning to regenerative practices with financing mechanisms and corporate engagement.\nDecentralized Environmental Data: Creating a decentralized platform for data access using blockchain.\n\nValue Consensus through Technology: Establishing value consensus through blockchain platforms.\nMetrics for Success: Metrics include increased community participation, waste reduction, traffic flow improvement, adoption of regenerative practices, and data decentralization.\n\nTech/Startup Sector in Guadalajara: Guadalajara has become a major tech hub in Latin America, with a thriving ecosystem supported by local talent, educational institutions, and government.\n\nProject Overview: The Rancho El Mexicano (REM) initiative in Ixtlahuacán del Río focuses on nature conservation through sustainable and regenerative methodologies. The project aims to rejuvenate the local ecosystem, emphasizing soil health, carbon sequestration, and wildlife augmentation. It seeks to promote regenerative food production and stimulate economic growth by integrating ecosystem regeneration into a productive value chain.\n\nGeographic Focus: The project is located near the Santiago River and the Achichilco Stream, areas of significant ecological importance. The region faces pressures from agriculture, livestock farming, and agave production.\n\nProject Scalability and Replication: REM serves as a practical demonstration of sustainable land use, providing a replicable model for others. The project's scalability is enhanced by the establishment of a natural park, water harvesting initiatives, and the Santiago River initiative.\n\nBenefits of the Project:\nSocial: Inclusive education and training programs, community empowerment, and behavioral-centered design.\n\nEconomic: Augmenting resources for proficient management and promoting sustainable business practices.\n\nEnvironmental: Fostering ecosystem regeneration and continuous provision of ecosystem services.\nNature Credit Finance: The project seeks nature credit finance to support its conservation initiatives, addressing the degradation of the Santiago and Verde River Ravines. Nature credit finance represents an investment in the project and a sustainable future for the region.\n\nLink to Demand Motivation: The project addresses immediate threats to the region's land and broader systemic issues of climate change and biodiversity loss. It aims to transition the existing supply chain towards regenerative agriculture, offering solutions for climate change adaptation and combating land degradation. The project also emphasizes biodiversity monitoring and data generation, underscoring the systemic relationship between biodiversity and human life.\n",

          "description": "#  Refi Amsterdam \n##  Why Amsterdam needs a Refi node. \nAmsterdam has a rich history of financial innovation. The world’s first central bank and stock exchange were established here. The city has a forward-looking finance sector which is renowned for its commitment to sustainability. Amsterdam is the first in the world to adopt the doughnut economic model, it ranked second on the Global Green Finance Index and it topped the Schroders’ European Sustainable Cities Index in 2021, which found Amsterdam’s environmental policies the best in Europe. The scene is grounded in a vibrant tech and startup ecosystem and sustainability runs through all sectors, from finance to fashion and farming. \nNevertheless, the climate finance movement is lagging. We don't have as many climate finance startups as a London or Berlin has. Even though the web3 community is thriving and there is a huge legacy of the hippie movement since the 60’s, there is still a strong tendency towards profit over impact.  The role that blockchain can play in our path towards a regenerative society remains underexplored and untold. We believe there is a bridge to build between web3, sustainability and fintech, and therefore we’re raising funds to start a local node. \n\n##  How we’ll realize our vision\n-  **Community building and engagement.** Inspire, educate & spark meaningful conversations and increase awareness around Refi ‘gedachtegoed’. Organize gatherings for like minded people to enhance a sense of belonging and purpose and set up events in collaboration with other stakeholders in the ecosystem (such as universities, municipalities and local web3 communities such as, Copernicus and W3bLab amsterdam). \n\n-  **Empowering local startups and founders.** amplifying Refi startups based in NL  /projects (Kumo / Landlife / carbify / senken / carbon equity / Coorest / collectivo). \n-  **Facilitate collaboration** and build some cool shit during our monthly coworking sessions. \n\n\n##  What is needed to make this happen\nWe aim to raise a sum of 6k to kick-off a Refi node in Amsterdam in the upcoming 5 months .\n- 1x pm coworking  @Collectivo office for 8-10 people. 4x €500 = €2000\n- 1x Refi event @Beurs van Berlage. Theme carbon markets or Ubi €1500. \n- 1x Refi Salon icw Project Copernicus €500\n- Comms & project management: €2000\n\n##  The driving force behind ReFi Amsterdam:\n-  Cynthia de Wolf: Digital marketing consultant who loves to help accelerate startups. Active in web3 since 2017. Core contributor at brightunion.io. Passionate about building communities. Tech enthusiast, tree hugger. loves to dance. \n\n-  Luuk Weber: Long-term Regen and founder of Kolektivo Labs. Experience running community events in Amsterdam with Blockchain Talks all the way back in 2018.\n\n##  Conclusion \nRefi Amsterdam's goal of establishing a local node to connect web3, sustainability, and fintech aligns well with Amsterdam's history and values. By fostering community engagement, supporting local startups, and facilitating collaboration, Refi Amsterdam aims to contribute to the growth of climate finance initiatives in the city. The grant will enable the establishment of the Refi node and the realization of the initiative's vision. \n\n\n",

However, many visionary entrepreneurs and projects often struggle to access the financial resources needed to scale their impact.\nThe node can act as a nexus, connecting these visionaries with impact investors, venture capitalists, and other sources of funding that share a commitment to sustainability.\n\nFacilitating Impact Investment:\n\nFinancial returns are aligned with positive social and environmental outcomes, having the node as a facilitator of impact investment deals, making it easier for investors to identify and support projects that contribute to both financial growth and sustainable development.\n\nBuilding a Network of Support:\n\nCcreate a collaborative ecosystem within Rio de Janeiro, bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and community leaders.\nThis network will provide not only financial support but also mentorship, expertise, and guidance to help sustainable initiatives succeed.\n\nEngaging Local Government and Institutions:\n\nThe Node will collaborate with local government bodies, universities, and research institutions to create an ecosystem that attracts investors and bolsters sustainable projects, working in tandem with existing initiatives and amplify their impact.\n\nIncluding! Social Impact.\n\nRio has so much of the potential and people to be benefited with the power of the Blockchain technology. But they need to be educated and have access. The Node will have a social aspect on finantial empowerment, specially for those living in the favelas, and on the margin of society. To growth as a community we must growth together. As powerful as a  new technology can be, if it benefits only part of the society, we will never trully develop.  ",

          "description": "Why Rio?\n\nFirst of all, Brazil hosts the majority of the Amazon Rainforest, which plays a critical role in global carbon sequestration and biodiversity, is a global leader in renewable energy production, with about 83% of its electricity coming from renewable sources, and is a signatory to the Paris Agreement, committing to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and taking steps to mitigate climate change.\n\nRio de Janeiro is known for its lush green spaces, including Tijuca National Park, the largest urban forest in the world, and other protected areas; Provide statistics on the growth of green building certifications (such as LEED) in Rio, demonstrating the city's commitment to sustainable urban development; Rio is also a hub for cultural and artistic expression related to sustainability and environmental awareness; \n\nWhat the Node would do?\n\nConnecting Visionaries with Capital:\n\nRio is a city with a rich history of innovation and sustainability efforts. However, many visionary entrepreneurs and projects often struggle to access the financial resources needed to scale their impact.\nThe node can act as a nexus, connecting these visionaries with impact investors, venture capitalists, and other sources of funding that share a commitment to sustainability.\n\nFacilitating Impact Investment:\n\nFinancial returns are aligned with positive social and environmental outcomes, having the node as a facilitator of impact investment deals, making it easier for investors to identify and support projects that contribute to both financial growth and sustainable development.\n\nBuilding a Network of Support:\n\nCcreate a collaborative ecosystem within Rio de Janeiro, bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and community leaders.\nThis network will provide not only financial support but also mentorship, expertise, and guidance to help sustainable initiatives succeed.\n\nEngaging Local Government and Institutions:\n\nThe Node will collaborate with local government bodies, universities, and research institutions to create an ecosystem that attracts investors and bolsters sustainable projects, working in tandem with existing initiatives and amplify their impact.\n\nIncluding! Social Impact.\n\nRio has so much of the potential and people to be benefited with the power of the Blockchain technology. But they need to be educated and have access. The Node will have a social aspect on finantial empowerment, specially for those living in the favelas, and on the margin of society. To growth as a community we must growth together. As powerful as a  new technology can be, if it benefits only part of the society, we will never trully develop.  ",

          "title": "Dynamic Optimization Algorithm for Self-regulating Tokenomics",
          "description": "Most tokenomics policies today (e.g. inflation rate, burning rate) are either coded statically or rely on DAO governance for adjustments. This approach ensures decentralization, but the lack of real-time response mechanisms also make the tokenomics vulnerable to the impact of external shocks, such as a large price movements and hacks.\n\nHow do we design tokenomics that is robust against these shocks, while preserving decentralization? The bold yet rational answer is: let a bot run the economy.\n\nIn this research project, my aim is to build an autonomous algorithm that regulates a blockchain economy with two key parameters: staking rate and burning rate. In particular, I apply a modeling tool from modern macroeconomic theory called DSGE, which is the gold standard used by central banks worldwide to determine key economic parameters like interest rates. Cutting-edge data science tools such as machine learning and causal inference models will be applied in the calibration process. This research will provide guidance for the new generation of protocol tokenomics.\n\n**About the researcher**\n\nMy name is Ming and I am a graduate student and researcher at UChicago studying computational economics. I've worked as a research fellow at Nethermind and DeFi research analyst at Polygon. You can learn more about me and my previous work at https://sites.google.com/view/mingxuanhe\n\n**Improvements on existing approaches**\n\nThe idea of optimizing burning and staking using dynamic modeling tools has seen growing exploration recently (e.g. @urosnoetic's post about BME in the previous round of TE grants, and multiple papers from the economics/finance literature in 2022/2023). My novelty is to develop a fully testable, calibratable model that also addresses uncertainty and lack of information. I also address key concerns such as algorithmic bias and systemic economic inequalities.\n\n**Current state**\n\nI have formalize the baseline model (Biais et al, 2020) in the context of tokenomics, and I'm currently in the phase of building the full model. [Presentation slides](https://github.com/mingxuan-he/dp-tokenomics/blob/master/Presentations/pitch_slides.pdf) can be found under the project github repo. The slides summarizes the current state of the research project, include a detailed introduction for the project, literature review, some technical components, and next steps.\n\n**Expected outcome**\n\nThe expected result is a complete MA thesis paper (15-30 pages) which will go under the review of a graduate research committee at University of Chicago Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics. \nThe end goal is to publish the paper in a peer-reviewed journal or conference. Before publication, I will open source the working paper and any relevant code on Github. The project is expected to take 4-5 months, with an upper limit of 8 months.\n\n**Funding Usage**\n\nAs an international student in the US, it is extremely difficult to receive academic scholarships and research funding because of my foreign status. That's why I turned to this community of fellow builders for help. Funding from this grant would help me cover part of my advanced studies in computational economics as well as some paid research tools. Here's a plan on how the funding will be used on this project:\n- Data: will try to use public data for initial stages, but later stages likely requires subscription-based APIs or databases (~$50/month * 5 months)\n- Computational resources: I will need to use credit-based computing services such as AWS or the Midway Cluster for running large-scale computation and machine learning models. An example can be found at https://github.com/mingxuan-he/eth-fee-time-series (~$80/month * 5 months)\n- Journal/conference submission & traveling expenses (~$1000)\n- Total: ~$1650\nAny additional funding will be directed towards creating more accessible community content such as explainers, blog posts, and open-source widgets.",

          "description": "Hey **Solarpunk**, stoked to have you here 🌞\n\nOur mission - **Put Eco in Economy**\n\nOur Vision - **Seed the Solarpunk paradigm**\n\nTo make this happen we are building **$Earth** - A digital currency thats backed by real world climate assets, ecosystem services provided by those assets and solarpunk values.\n\n[![c4be5546-9432-47eb-9701-539a9463e73d-logo-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wj5qjVNW/c4be5546-9432-47eb-9701-539a9463e73d-logo-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/gxJFM3NR)\n\n\n# $Earth leverages crypto-economics and blockchain to -\n\n1. Mobilize and incentivize primary finance for projects in the following sectors that are building infrastructure for an absolute zero emission future and address the massive climate finance gap of over $4-5 Trillion/yr needed to do so :\n\n- **Clean Energy**☀️\n- **Regenerative Agriculture**🌱\n- **Clean Transport**⚡\n- **Ecosystem Conservation**🐆\n- **Solarpunk Spaces**🌇\n\n\n2. Create pricing mechanisms to **value natural ecosystems and their services** while creating a monetary system that is backed by assets catering to our core needs\n\n3. Program **solarpunk values** into a currency\n\n\n[![0-1-3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8cGrXbqx/0-1-3.png)](https://postimg.cc/sQnXv5fJ)\n\n\n# To make this happen, $Earth has been designed to -\n\n1. Incentivize degens, regens, treegens and solarpunks to **purge their petro $$$ for $Earth** which has a floating, range bound currency design. $Earth holders then use Quadratic Voting to determine which verified projects get funded via the treasury.\n\n2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world.\n\n$Earth acts as a **new unit of value** for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate + the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc) + solarpunk values it manifests\n\n3. Generating utility for $Earth by creating a **network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants** who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth.\n\n# Due to your incredible support in the Beta round where we managed to come 4th from 102 participants we were able to -\n\n1. Finally register our entity from which we can officially issue $Earth.\n2. Pay for our legal tool kit which contains important documents such as Terms of Service, Privacy policy, KYC/AML policy to offer $Earth.\n3. Pay our devs\n4. Hire an intern to help us with community building and operations\n5. Keep aside a smol budget for marketing and promoting $Earth once we launch ( hopefully done by the time you are reading this)\n6. Launch our #SolarpunkUniverse NFT collection where we are creating bespoke Solarpunk characters, a truly one of its kind NFT collection\n7. Continue survivng the bear and working full time on this project\n8. Initiate payment for KYC services and pay for AI tools like Midjourney, Kaiber\n\n# Solarpunk #16,17 and 19 from our #SolarpunkUniverseNFT collection\n\n[![Screenshot-2023-08-04-192309.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/c1THNZYv/Screenshot-2023-08-04-192309.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/QV9sp2fD)\n\n# With the funds expected from this round we will be working on -\n\n1. Creating a smart contract that serves as an aqueduct for $Earth, where lending/borrowing platform and Dexes will be able to let their users redirect yields earned from there towards minting/staking $Earth\n2. Hire solarpunks to help us with content creation, community management and provide us with Credit Risk recommendations on the projects that $Earth treasury intends to fund\n3. Launch 2 more NFT collections that will also serve as aqueducts for $Earth and assist in community building.\n4. Create a subsidiary entity that interacts with real world entities and holds our investment deeds\n5. Pay a designer to create a new version of the website+dapp\n6. Initiate dialouge with aligned partners whose projects we seek to fund and have them serve as collateral for $Earth.\n7. Keep a budget to market and promote $Earth\n8. Hopefully to be able to conduct an IRL event to shill $Earth\n\n\nWould be important to mention here that we are on the verge of launching $Earth on mainnet and this has been made possible only because of all the love from our contributors and incredible support from Gitcoin. \n\nWe are extremely grateful for this  and are working tirelessly to deliver the solarpunk future 🙏\n\n[![SL-64.png](https://i.postimg.cc/d3hgX8rm/SL-64.png)](https://postimg.cc/FkQPkkP7)\n\n",

          "description": "## Introduction\nWhen you step into ChainPray, this unique blockchain prayer platform, you will discover **a world full of warmth and care**. Unlike those projects solely focused on wealth and profits, ChainPray chooses to turn its attention to ordinary users in the cryptocurrency community who have been affected by hackers, bad actors, and liquidations, providing them with heartfelt spiritual support to make them feel truly cared for and supported.\n\nChainPray ingeniously blends traditional prayers with advanced blockchain technology. On this magical platform, every user has the right to **claim one \"PrayLuck\" (PrayLuck Coin) for free every day**. By activating the daily prayer feature, users receive blessings from the blockchain, starting their day with positivity and goodness. This precious gift allows you to feel the platform's thoughtfulness and care.\n\nIn addition, ChainPray offers many exciting and meaningful additional features, such as \"**Destiny Pray**\", \"**GoodMan Contributions**\", \"**God Competitions**\", and \"**Sunny Award**\". These features not only add fun but also make you experience the colorful and wonderful aspects of life.\n\n## Token Pass System\nChainPray's token economy consists of two tokens, **PrayLuck** and **PrayLuckStar**, along with the issuance of **NFTs** with different attributes. PrayLuckStar is obtained by users through the probability of \"Destiny Pray\", and the more times users pray, the more accumulated luck they have, making it easier to obtain PrayLuckStar. ChainPray also releases NFTs with various attributes to help users acquire PrayLuckStar more easily. For detailed information, please refer to the TokenPlan section on the [ChainPray official website](https://chainpray.com).\n\n## Profit and Rewards\nChainPray's mission is not limited to providing spiritual support to cryptocurrency users. During the project's operation, **DAO will regularly distribute the \"Sunny Award\" of PrayLuck to random ChainPray users**. This portion of PrayLuck comes entirely from users' prayer consumption, reflecting a concept of \"**taking from the people, giving back to the people.**\" In the later stages of the ChainPray project, PrayLuckStar obtained through Destiny Prayers will have various consumer use cases, such as purchasing advertising space on ChainPray, issuing chain-wide announcements, buying unique NFTs, and more. Therefore, ChainPray will generate profits, and **the DAO will continue to use a significant portion of the profits to carry out \"Sunny Award\" for random ChainPray users**.\n\n## Team\nChainPray's backend team boasts 5 years of experience in the internet industry and **5 years of experience in blockchain development**. Additionally, the smart contract development team has **4 years of experience specifically in Ethereum smart contracts**. The smart contracts used by ChainPray are developed using **Solidity**, ensuring simplicity and have undergone a thorough audit by multiple seasoned smart contract developers with years of experience in the cryptocurrency community. This ensures that **there are no contract security issues present**.\n\n## Invitation card\nWe sincerely invite you to personally experience the unique charm of ChainPray and let your soul be nurtured and enlightened. ChainPray looks forward to sharing unforgettable moments with you, creating beautiful and heartwarming memories together. On this platform filled with blessings and care, let us embark on an unforgettable journey together.",

          "description": "**Fau0x Salon Governance RPG Card Deck**\n\nWe at the 0x Salon have developed a non-Web3-specific card game (Fau0x Salon, 2021) which serves as a discursive tool for participants to role-play post-disciplinary conversations from a variety of perspectives. The card deck \"pops-up\" salon-style events (intimate and diverse peer-group discussions) with some facilitation, allowing participants to role-play through problems, topics, and governance tensions from the perspectives of fictional character archetypes rather than themselves. We have been invited to present the Fau0x Salon project in an exhibition in Switzerland in November. The 2021 version of the card deck is here: https://www.are.na/0x-salon/wip-salon-deck-v2\n\nWe would like to prepare a Web3-specific version of this card deck, and seek contributions to help us with R&D, design, playtest, and production costs. Our goal is to complete a new version of the deck, do a series of playtests and workshops at Web3 events, make many hard copies available, and open-source the deck so that anyone can print their own copy and play.\n\nIn a way, we are developing a \"Web3 governance therapy tool\" ﻿🚀﻿. One problem we are trying to solve is around the 'eternal September' problem of welcoming new people into the Web3 ecosystem with nuanced and unbiased information. There's also a related challenge, in the 'governance' of the human organisations that necessarily form around decentralised protocols, such as foundations, startups, benefactors, investors, as well as developers, miners / validators / service providers, users, …. Due to the complex balance of stakeholder incentives in Ethereum and other Web3 networks, individual stakeholders may not be incentive-aligned, which can lead to “off-chain tensions” or even adversarial behaviour that is detrimental to the protocol.\n\nDue to these somewhat split loyalties, and the distributed nature of many Web3 project teams, time spent together IRL (where communication is most effective) is scarce. Having a “governance RPG” as a tool for teams to role-play through scenarios would enable team members to work through points of tension, without bringing their own personal characters or desiderata into the equation.  \n\n**About the 0x Salon**\n0x Salon is a collective endeavour which critically interrogates digital culture — primarily that of the blockchain community — through discourse events and residencies, producing scholarly and creative interventions in the process. \n\nSince 2020, we have been hosting salons ⁠— intimate post-disciplinary discussions ⁠— on a range of conversation topics. We are conducting an ongoing, non-profit experiment in knowledge sharing and collective cultural production. \n\nStewarded by 0x Salon team members, our community researches topics, organises events, and produces lore, critical theory, poetry, philosophy, games, theatre, and visual art. Our website principally functions as a transmedia archival space, chronicling discussions within the 0x Salon and the resulting activities.",

Due to the complex balance of stakeholder incentives in Ethereum and other Web3 networks, individual stakeholders may not be incentive-aligned, which can lead to “off-chain tensions” or even adversarial behaviour that is detrimental to the protocol.\n\nDue to these somewhat split loyalties, and the distributed nature of many Web3 project teams, time spent together IRL (where communication is most effective) is scarce. Having a “governance RPG” as a tool for teams to role-play through scenarios would enable team members to work through points of tension, without bringing their own personal characters or desiderata into the equation.

Pulling data from our first API, we have built our database, and are reviewing the data we have pulled to determine its usefulness and accuracy.\n\nWe will begin to build the automated agent that serves to construct our curated datasets and update them automatically every 30 days for Ocean Marketplace.\n\nWe will sell our datasets on Ocean Marketplace for very low prices.  Once the PoC has been validated, we will apply for a grant via Ocean Protocol Shipyard.  With additional funds, alongside tapping into more API's and building more curated datasets, we will  build an AI Model that will allow subscribers to query the datatsets and derive insight from them. (see #3 in Growth Strategies below)\n\n### **Target Audience:**\n\nData scientists (specifically web3 for MVP)\n\nAI Builders\n\nToken Engineers\n\n**The Problem(s):** \n\nExisting on-chain data providers offer data through APIs:\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Require technical expertise to use (can be a barrier for others that lack technical expertise)\n- Data is often raw and unfiltered\n- Time-consuming to extract meaningful insights (This can involve cleaning the data, dealing with missing or inconsistent data, aggregating data, calculating metrics, and so on. ) Can be a barrier for those that lack time\n\n### **DataBites Benefits:**\n\n1. DataBites provides curated datasets, saving users the time and effort of data extraction and cleaning. \n2. Our datasets are tailored to the needs of our users, providing them with the specific data they need for their analysis or research. \n3.

          "description": "[EVMcrispr](https://evmcrispr.com) is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify interactions with smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains. **It enables users to send transactions using intuitive, UNIX-like commands**, allowing for the creation of complete scripts that perform multiple arbitrary actions from the injected wallet in the web browser. This makes it easier to write complex scripts for various day-to-day blockchain operations, such as creating efficient DAO votes, launching and managing DAO configurations, performing DeFi strategies, running simulations on drafted on-chain actions, and creating, sending, and managing tokens.\n\nEVMcrispr effectively lowers the technical barriers for web3 users to engage in and execute complex tasks using smart contracts. The tool's **domain-specific language is useful for expressing and transforming transaction data**. It has been adopted by organizations like Curve, Aragon, NFTX, 1Hive, Giveth, TECommons, BrightId, and Agave to conduct intricate votes within their Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nThe tool boasts a terminal-like interface, complemented by clear documentation and numerous examples, making it easy for users to start. **It eliminates the need for a customized frontend to interact with Ethereum**, as users can simply write and share scripts with others for execution.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are examples of scripts that perform day-to-day ENS actions. You can find more examples on how to use EVMcrispr [in the documentation](https://evmcrispr.com).\n\n\n#### How to set an avatar image for your ENS\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZR6ekSW.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.eth.limo/#/terminal/QmU6fkoE2sRXCqtDSy7ZcZu3wefq3XxwpSy5BH2juyRdT1)\n\n\n#### How to set a lockup address\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jsTsO6o.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.com/#/terminal/QmU8rZYn3azqEvVHX3KGAh9i8fMfLdnp8r5QegosZCThuN)\n\n\n#### How to extend an ENS domain for 1 year\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7EdnXXc.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.com/#/terminal/QmNvK7tRpBjh8Q11hZ9Rs8e477R2Wc8dSpbzPXqEXABXNG)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nEVMcrispr is committed to continuous improvement and expansion of its features. The following next steps have been identified to enhance the tool and user experience:\n\n1.  **Bug fixing and improved error messages:** Addressing and resolving any existing issues or bugs in the current implementation, ensuring a seamless user experience. We are dedicated to refining error messages to better inform users about potential issues and failures.\n2.  **Formal language specification:** Developing a well-defined and comprehensive formal language specification to provide clear guidance for users and facilitate future improvements. The language specification will also be useful for LLMs to program transactions properly.\n3.  **Event handling and output integration:** Implementing event handling capabilities to enable better tracking and monitoring of smart contract events and transactions. The outputs of the events will be made available in the script to inform and initiate subsequent transactions.\n4.  **Safe support:** Integrating support for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), a widely-used smart contract wallet, to further broaden EVMcrispr's compatibility and utility for users within the ecosystem.\n5.  **Improved ENS support:** EVMcrispr will make ENS names first-class citizens of the domain-specific language. The tool already supports the `namehash` function, and the `contenthash` function will be added to enhance ENS-related capabilities.\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, EVMcrispr aims to become an even more versatile and valuable tool for interacting with smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains.\n\nThe source code for EVMcrispr can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/EVMcrispr/evmcrispr) under the GPLv3 license.",

          "description": "HarbergerToken is an innovative open-source project token solution based on blockchain technology that aims to address the long-standing sustainability issue faced by open-source communities. Anyone, including the open-source project owner, can create an HBG Token for any open-source project. Through the tax mechanism and risk-free mortgage feature, HBG Token provides a mutually beneficial ecosystem for open-source projects and investors. __Core features include risk-free mortgage, high capital utilization (up to 60x for early buyers), and the tax mechanism.__\n\nThe tax rights are assetized into two types of NFTs: Create NFT and Owner NFT. Create NFT has a 5% tax allocation right obtained by the person who creates the HBG Token (the creation price is GitHub stars multiplied by 0.1 $FIND; open-source project owners can create for free). Owner NFT has a 95% tax allocation right, and open-source project owners can claim it for free. The income before the Owner NFT is claimed belongs to the platform.\n\n![NFT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105170140/231097911-4baa40b0-667d-418b-9d9b-b9a0afc81c7c.jpg)\n\nHBG Token adopts an issuance method without reservation, where all tokens are placed in the Uniswap pool and cannot be withdrawn. This issuance method makes the liquidity more secure, and there is no liquidity risk.\n\nThe risk-free mortgage feature of HarbergerToken allows users to borrow $FIND & $ETH tokens by mortgaging HBG Tokens, which enables low-risk capital gains. For early buyers, HarbergerToken can also provide up to 60x capital utilization, greatly improving the efficiency of capital utilization. This efficient capital utilization not only reduces investors' risks but also creates more value for open-source projects.\n\nIn summary, HarbergerToken is committed to providing continuous financial support for open-source projects while also providing investors with a highly promising trading asset. Through risk-free lending, high capital utilization, and innovative tax mechanisms, HarbergerToken becomes an ideal bridge between open-source projects and investors.\n\n### links\n\nWebsite:  https://harberger.money/\nVideo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs5WH582Llo\nWhitepaper:  https://medium.com/@HarbergerToken/0xfind-whitepaper-en-8fca1e0b94a5\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/YQzvAGkqcg\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/HarbergerToken\nGithub:  https://github.com/0xfind\n",

Our token issuance mechanism, especially with the creation of two NFTs (Create NFT and Owner NFT) representing tax collection rights, is a pioneering step in the blockchain space. By leveraging Uniswap V3 features, we've successfully implemented a risk-free lending function, eliminating issues like the death spiral. This no-risk, no-interest, no-liquidation lending offers up to 67x capital efficiency, potentially jump-starting open-source projects.\nFurthermore, our project inherently promotes a positive-sum game, where the HBG token's price reflects the community's consensus on an open-source project. This financial motivation encourages active community participation in testing, documentation, sharing, and even operations, resulting in a closely-knit community.\nIn essence, HarbergerToken not only pushes the envelope in token engineering but also fosters community building, collaboration, and sustainable growth in open-source projects. As a public good, it offers both tangible financial incentives and intangible social benefits to its community."

By fully leveraging the capabilities of Uniswap V3 and innovating with concepts like the Harberger tax, we've designed a financial model that offers risk-free borrowing — a significant departure from conventional models plagued by issues like the death spiral.\nMoreover, our project aims to quantify the consensus about open-source projects through the HBG token's price, which has real-world implications. For example, timely releases of project milestones can boost token value, while delays might lead to its depreciation.\nPreviously, we made our mark by securing the third position in the Uniswap bounties track during the Zero2Hero hackathon co-organized by BNB Chain and encodeclub. We're always open to collaborations and affiliations that align with our vision and can amplify our reach."

          "description": "# on-chain realtime hack prevention\n\n### we are building on-chain firewalls\n\n---\n\n## What is an On-Chain Smart Contract Firewall?\n\nSmart contract hacks have been plaguing DeFi protocols, bridges, and more.\n\nToday, in order to defend themselves, protocols perform audits, open bug bounties, and implement monitoring.\n\nAll of these steps are absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.\n\nYou can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.\n\nOur Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:\n\n- Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.\n- Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).\n- Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.\n\nThe Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.\n\n---\n\n## Our Roadmap\n\n### **Phase 1: Research & Proof-of-Concept**\n\n- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th August 2023\n\nThis phase will focus on in-depth research and the creation of proof-of-concepts demonstrating how tailored firewall can enhance the security and functionality of protocols.\n\n### Milestone 2: Prototyping & Production\n\n- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Months\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th October 2023\n\nThe second phase will concentrate on the development and testing of firewall prototypes based on the findings of the first phase. The prototypes will showcase the practicality and benefits of integrating on-chain firewalls into DeFi Protocols.\n\n### Milestone 3: Testnet Deployment\n- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th November 2023\n\n## The final phase will involve the testnet deployment of all firewall components, followed by rigorous testing and refinement to ensure the system is ready for potential mainnet audits and protocol implementations.\n\n## **Our Goals**\n\n- Reliability\n- Inexpensive in gas terms. The overhead must remain negligible.\n- Not adding complexity to the protected contract(s): Implementing the Firewall must not require more than a few lines of Solidity code.\n- It must scale\n\n---\n\n# TL;DR ⤵️\n\n## **How Does It Work?**\n\n**You can track any critical metric that could be indicative of an exploit happening for your protocol.**\n\n### Let's take the example of TVL:\n\nEvery time there is an inflow or outflow of liquidity, you add a call to the Firewall contract to track the TVL at this point in time within your protocol. The Firewall will keep a history of your TVL over time.\nThis allows you to define a threshold so that if more than X% of the TVL exits the protocol in less than Y number of blocks, the Firewall triggers.\nWhen this happens, the Firewall status is updated before the transaction is committed, which allows you to implement a set of defensive strategies to prevent the transaction from going through, such as rejecting the transaction or freezing the funds.\n\nAll of this happens synchronously, at the contract level in Solidity. This means that exploits are prevented from happening automatically, and directly on-chain.\n\nYou can find a more detailed explanation of the Firewall [here](https://turtleshell.gitbook.io/introduction/how-it-works).\n\n### **Protective Measures**\n\nOnce the Firewall gets triggered, protocols can use it in various ways to protect their assets. Here are some of the protective measures that can be taken:\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/56e03ba6-c890-4df6-8063-6b922adce341/firewall_triggered.svg?id=0df407f8-b92c-40bd-bbb0-27c2d94cb8f2&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691712000000&signature=4DUMvFXQlMfGejNNjJNO3gfV2P985i2wzAOK2NnxRic&downloadName=firewall_triggered.svg)\n___\n## **Implementation and Integration**\n\n1. **Setup configuration**: Define the parameter you want to track (e.g: TVL) and a maximum threshold that should not be reached within a custom time period.\n2. **Identify Entry Points**: This step consists of listing functions that affect your parameter. For TVL, that would be functions that increase or decrease liquidity (e.g., deposit & withdraw).\n3. **Integrate the Firewall**: For each entry point, you must add a single line of code to call the Firewall to track this parameter.\n4. **Choose and Implement a Defensive Strategy**: Every time you call the firewall, it returns its status. If the firewall triggers, you implement one of our strategies: reject transaction, freeze funds, pause protocol, etc.\n5. **Monitor and Adjust**: After integration, you can monitor the operation of the firewall and adjust the parameters as needed. This allows you to fine-tune the system to better protect your protocol.\n\nRemember, the key to effective use of the Firewall is understanding your protocol's specific needs and adjusting the parameters accordingly. With the right configuration, the Firewall can provide a robust line of defence against potential hacks and unauthorized fund withdrawals.\n\n### What does a Solidity integration look like?\n\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw(uint256 withdrawAmount) external override {\n\t[...]\n\t// Firewall implementation\n\tbool firewallTriggered = IFirewall(firewall).decreaseParameter(withdrawAmount);\n\tif (firewallTriggered) return;\n\t[...]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Why it is important what we build\n\nMost established exploit prevention procedures like performing security audits are important, yet, we must understand that these have limitations and cannot asses risks beyond code produced by the engineering team. External dependencies as potential attack vectors are frequently being disregarded or *assumed* to be safe, as they lies outside a single protocol’s spectrum of actionable security measures. Given the example of the most recent curve exploit: Auditing legacy versions of the Vyper compiler, was undoubtably out of the protocol’s security scope.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/85dbe180-0f88-43d0-b684-3f5ddc7ee6d7/no_firewall.svg?id=2fd27862-22c1-449b-81bf-c117ffccb8d1&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=PS-S6gi09av2Uy1msnYxh3AwuDbYIgL69Ki0CaGgYks&downloadName=no_firewall.svg)\n\nEven when exploring hypothetical scenarios, e.g.: All protocols using Vyper coming together beforehand and collectively sourcing audits for Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0, it still would not have solved the underlying problem: The *unknown (un)knowns* of vulnerable external dependencies. Given the infinite amount of unknowns, it is merely impossible to effectively draw the line between where to start and stop security audits.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/abea7062-fba8-4f89-a092-2bd3acc966a9/no_firewall_cycle.svg?id=7c4d140d-5252-4bdb-9b52-87f9d0b3d111&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=AsCb8siZEWEKliqMvSBaoxR5475sCUusyNiHfVYeEHk&downloadName=no_firewall_cycle.svg)\n\nThis is why protocols have to hope for the best while keeping their fingers crossed🤞once deploying code to production. In essence: Hoping they won’t have to face any *unknown (un)knowns* in production, but if so, hopefully only through bug bounties programs and whitehats. Usually, the financial incentives for blackhat hackers largely outweigh bug bounty initiatives, leading to exploits of undiscovered attack vectors. Furthermore, in accordance to Murphy’s Law, the above strategy would lead to a hack in any case, sooner or later.\n\n---\n\n## Actionable opportunities to protect the protocol\n\n### Adding Firewalls to the protocols production deployments\n\nAs an additional layer of protection to the protocol Firewalls can be added to mitigate in-production risks.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/d657a457-f1ff-466e-9fda-834e5e2b6960/firewall_cycle.svg?id=d1fea3f9-a839-40f7-8e72-4dcc0498d5e8&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=Y4vDfcAEbwx3fLlS0yTAleP-XeC7qrADIJVLCKWOn8I&downloadName=firewall_cycle.svg)\n\n***Even tough, the way the protocol gets exploited relies on an unknown (un)known, the target of the exploit always is a KNOWN KNOWN, being liquidity.***\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/cd611ba0-e6e6-44e4-a1c4-092a1877ed5a/unknown.svg?id=d9fd796b-f684-407b-a9ab-785bf935a8fc&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=Rs29pxwyQ4EgZG8_SRs_YACvA148i-9veTuyPF15XMY&downloadName=unknown.svg)\n\n**→ Therefore, we can work with the known characteristics of every exploit happening, instead of trying to solve what we cannot know.**\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/9718190a-5d8d-4a1a-8247-bf489d4d1dc8/known.svg?id=ac678746-28bf-476b-a468-33cfd9666b0d&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=qYYMfTnH_9NG-nOIhB7OW1KUd9pdzw-cqtipj4sHQxM&downloadName=known.svg)\n\nWe are aware of the attackers target: extracting Liquidity.\n\nWe are aware of external dependencies, will most likely lead the attacker to his target.\n\n***→ knowing and understanding these two crucial pieces of information, we can design a security system around these two vectors.***\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/a001b4cf-e63b-4571-a210-9aa9c2f0014b/firewall.svg?id=28da97a7-5a30-4082-a7fb-3614752aa556&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=0wuyiOSBTjiTbHH2yNWtAeakYUduNI0-zZumI-bavD0&downloadName=firewall.svg)\n\nAs a wrapped layer of security around the protocol, the attacker will not be able to reach his intended target: *extracting liquidity*, with *external dependencies* as his attack vector. Even when vulnerabilities occur (e.g. faulty compilers), an attacker will not reach his target, as the Firewall system operates as an independent layer of security for the protocol.\n\nWhenever abnormal activity occurs, on-chain Firewall’s offer a range of protective measures, including blocking of transactions, pausing the protocol, freezing of funds, or controlled fund withdrawal, thereby providing a robust on-chain defence against potential hacks.\n\n## Resources:\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turtleshell_xyz)\n- [Team’s Website](https://turtleshell.xyz/)\n- [Docs](https://turtleshell.gitbook.io/)\n- [Team’s Github Organization](https://github.com/ikigai-labs-xyz/turtleshell-core)\n- [Demo Repository](https://github.com/ikigai-labs-xyz/turtleshell-core)\n- [relevant Firewall Demo of a L&B Market](https://www.loom.com/share/f6981c21abd54afc8b29565de1d3ea3a?t=2)",

That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.\n\n___\n\nWe'll know our project was a success when we observe increased adoption rates, reduced security incidents in the token ecosystem, and receive positive feedback from the community, signaling enhanced trust and robustness in the DeFi space.\n\nBest case scenario:\n\nA protocol is under attack, but was able to block the attack with the firewall integration."

With Gitcoin donations, we will continue **providing blueprints and tools for impact communities to realize economic sustainability and shared resource governance**.\n\nLeveraging our success with the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436) and [Economic Co-design](https://medium.com/commonsstack/a-non-violent-revolution-against-technocracy-53388b123936) for the [Token Engineering Commons (TEC)](https://tecommons.org/), we aim to further enable more communities to launch their own economies by refining, documenting, and promoting our open-source tools and protocols for creating **sustainable token economies and equitable governance system**. \n\nDonate to Commons Stack and support our solutions for funding, governance and public goods management.\n\nThank you for your generosity! 🙏\n\n\n# 🌎 ABOUT COMMONS STACK\n\nWe innovate at the intersection between culture and token engineering!\n\nCommons Stack builds technical tools and cultural frameworks that enable impact initiatives to evolve into decentralized, regenerative, self-governing communities. Our expertise lies in guiding communities through the process of creating an organizational structure that facilitates active participation, cooperation, and accountability. You can build a community-driven ecosystem that fosters positive change and ensures your project’s long-term success.\n\nThese four pillars present our approach to funding, governance, and public goods management:\n\n**Cultural frameworks:**  We provide comprehensive cultural frameworks that empower impact-focused communities to form, fundraise, and govern effectively, ensuring their long-term success. These frameworks are designed to accommodate the unique needs and challenges of DAOs, offering flexible, research-based solutions that respect both collective and individual autonomy.\n\n**Economics Co-design:** We champion Economic Co-design, a methodology that promotes inclusion, transparency, and active participation, enabling community members to create their own economic design proposals. This ensures diverse perspectives are heard, fostering the growth of innovative and practical solutions tailored to community needs through a 3-step process: educate, propose, and vote.\n\n**Research:** We conduct research to innovate collective governance and economic design tools for web3. Our research-led approach allows us to create adaptable templates that cater to the unique needs of diverse communities.\n\n**Library of Tools:** We curate a library of tools, comprised of modular, interoperable solutions that empower communities to fund projects and establish regenerative token economies. These tools, including the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting, facilitate the launch of CommonsDAO and complement the creation of a sustainable, polycentric governance model.\n\n\n# 🤝 OUR COMMITMENT TO OPEN SOURCE\n\nOpen source fosters a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual respect. It gives builders worldwide access to tools and resources that collectively drive research and social and technological advancements.\n\nWe champion a culture of radical openness as we believe transparency advances projects and productivity ethically and inclusively. We actively practice the philosophy of open source by building in public.\n\n\n# 📣 UPDATES SINCE GITCOIN BETA ROUND\n\n🚀 **Website Launch:** Our new website is live! We’ve spent the last couple of months reflecting on our culture, our mission and our work. Our new website highlights our mission and presents our work more clearly. Have a look: [https://www.commonsstack.org/](https://www.commonsstack.org/).  \n\n![Commons Stack’s new website](https://imgur.com/pxwBYVm.png) \n\n🧰 **CommonsDAO Toolkit:** We’ve been in pursuit of more funding to expand the reach of our CommonsDAO tooling, including the ABC and Conviction voting. We’ve been recently selected for Optimism Cycle 13 Builder Grant to extend our innovative CommonsDAO tooling, along with the Aragon DAO formation and management tooling, to the Optimism chain. The result will allow any community on Optimism to easily launch their own ABC! \n\n🗣️ **Event Talks:** We’ve been actively sharing our knowledge and insights at ETHBarcelona and EthCC. Our team delivered key presentations addressing crucial topics like token engineering, the power of myths, and the concept of a market for public goods. Watch the [full playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy6j39s17_jQRNO4vli-3WGZ8RaivFqLM) of our talks.\n\n![Livia Deschermayer at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/W2wiPwr.png) \n\n\n![Tamara Helenius at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/eM7ta2g.png) \n\n\n![Griff Green at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/4M0bO2k.png) \n\n\n# 💰 PLANS FOR GG18 ROUND FUNDING\n\nFunding from this round will support our ongoing initiative - porting the Aragon client and  CommonsDAO tooling to Optimism chain. We received a 40K OP token grant from Optimism for this piece of work but (1) it does not actually cover the full scope of work and (2) the tokens will be locked for one year. Donations now will help us bridge that gap. This project is important because it lays the technical foundation for the TEC, should the community decide, to migrate to the Optimism chain. Additionally, it will allow projects and communities on Optimism to deploy their own Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC). \n\nThe success of this project will extend our CommonsDAO tooling to the Optimism community. This means **more projects gaining access to our innovative tools and ability to launch an ABC** to fund and govern their missions, empowering them to create sustainable token economies and effective governance models. We are working with our partners, Blossom Labs and General Magic, to realize this work.\n\nIn addition to supporting our specific projects, the funding from GG18 will provide a much-needed boost to our overall operations, particularly in navigating the challenges of the bear market. 🐻  We believe in the resilience and potential of the Commons Stack community, and with your support, we can continue to innovate and drive impact, regardless of market conditions.\n\n\n# 👥 OUR TEAM\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive work environment and prioritizing diversity and inclusion. Our team is 80% female team! And we span diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds, including **women from the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina and US/France**. \n\n[Tamara Helenius](https://twitter.com/tamarandom) - Tamara is a co-founder of Commons Stack,  and a former steward and current advisor for the Token Engineering Commons (TEC).

          "description": "# Project Title: DeSpace Quadratic Fund\n\n## Abstract \n\nTo align the Decentralized Space Exploration Ecosystem for public goods funding, we propose the DeSpace Quadratic Funding Grants Round. This initiative aims to raise and distribute funds to support the DeSpace ecosystem.\n\n## DeSpace Examples: \n- DAOs\n- NFT collections\n- Metaverses\n- Blockchain Nodes\n\n## Background: \nIn the previous community-driven [Decentralized Science Round on Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x6e8dc2e623204d61b0e59e668702654ae336c9f7), there was significant demand for Hardware & Decentralized Space Exploration projects. This round also laid the groundwork for the DeSpace QF because of intense preparations that built on top of the success of [DeSpace: Space Founder Circles](https://www.spacefoundercircles.com/) in collaboration with ReFiDAO. With the current momentum in the Web3 market, the project aims to fund public goods related to Outer Space using Quadratic Funding.\n\n## Problem Statement: \nStartups and research projects often face challenges in securing initial funding and public awareness. For Public Goods projects, such as Open Space/Lunar, funding challenges can hinder long-term independence and the acceleration of innovative space technologies.\n\n## Solution: \nThe rising popularity of DeSpace presents an opportunity to establish a platform that unifies the broader DeSpace ecosystem with aligned values as outlined in the [DeSpace Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWnfN8l2VlQA-n5QxNH9oDdJ1soqe-_EaQmVfi_G_9g/). The DeSpace Quadratic Fund aims to achieve this.\n\n## What is Decentralized Space Exploration: \nDecentralized Space Exploration is a sub-niche within web3 merging space exploration with decentralized systems. Instead of being dominated by major national space agencies or billionaires, this approach allows multiple entities or individuals to participate in space missions. Leveraging blockchain and community-driven initiatives, it promotes open-source technology, collective decision-making, and crowdfunding. This democratizes space activities, fostering inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation in Space by distributing control and participation across a broader community.\n\n## Public Good Definition: \nA Public Good is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. In the context of the \"DeSpace Quadratic Fund\", it refers to projects that benefit the broader decentralized space exploration community.\n\n## Quadratic Funding Explanation: \nQuadratic Funding (QF) is a democratic funding method for public goods. It prioritizes the number of contributors over the amount contributed, ensuring projects with broad community support receive appropriate funding.\n\n## Benefits of Quadratic Funding for Space Public Goods: \nThe first framework is proposed in the [DeSpace QF Lightpaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygLWjt32Na3fCXvuruUyoNKaXqS3urfkr63FjnTPMo0/). Using QF for space-related public goods ensures projects with wide community backing receive amplified funding. This approach captures the public's desires and needs, making it ideal for supporting space-related public goods projects.\n\n## Benefits: \n- Attract relevant DeSpace project audiences.\n- Raise awareness across the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Position as a hub for the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Provide initial funding and promotion for researchers and projects.\n- Create a Proof of Concept for Public Goods funding in Space Science.\n\n## Risks: \n- Insufficient initial funding.\n- Funding the wrong projects.\n- Potential for fraud and Sybil attacks.\n- High Gas Fees.\n- Challenges in KPI measurements & user onboarding.\n\n## Learnings from the Last Decentralized Science Round: \nThe team will leverage tools like Gitcoin’s Passport and Sybill Analysis Toolkit, switch to Optimism for low Gas Fees, and involve the B2B team for engagement.\n\n## Why this team? \nWe aligned leading DeSpace innovators, scientists and entrepreneurs from Space DAOs like [MoonDAO](https://moondao.com/), [SpaceRoxDAO](https://spacerox.org/), [Alpha Persei](https://alphapersei.com/) and [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to sit on one table, start this initiative and grow our ecosystem for the benefit of all!\n\nWe already committed advisors and supporters from [Copernic Space](https://copernicspace.com/), [Lunargistics](https://lunargistics.com/), [Axiom Space](https://www.axiomspace.com/) and [Astrocool](https://astrocool.com/) offering special perks to grantees or donors besides the Space DAOs already involved and more to be announced soon.\n\nConfirmed grantees are companies mentioned before, as well as, [Orbuculum](https://dlteo.com/), [MoonSociety](https://www.moonsociety.org/), [Lunco](https://lunco.space/), Open Lunar Comms and many more to be confirmed soon.\n\n## Objectives and Key Results: \n**Objective #1:** Conduct DeSpace QF Round on Gitcoin Grants Stack\n**Key Results for Objective #1:** \n- Raise a minimum of $25k from sponsors.\n- Draft Eligibility Criteria.\n- Get at least 10 grantees on the platform.\n- Facilitate the round.\n- Plan and execute co-marketing.\n- Build a DeSpace Cornerstone Fund for future Rounds\n\n## Metrics to measure success: \nMatching Pool Fund size, number of grantees, number of donors, amount and number of donations, marketing engagement metrics, number of sponsors/advisors, cross-promotion activities by grantees.\n\n## Founding Stewards: \n@ManuelOlariu\nManuel Olariu is the founder of DeepVenture.io and with Copernic Space he is building a space asset marketplace leading Innovation and IP standards. He is responsible for MoonDAO B2B while he is supporting various Decentralized Science and Decentralized Space activities. He led the last community-driven #GitcoinBeta Decentralized Science Grants Round utilizing Gitcoin's Grants Stack where MoonDAO played a critical part as the main initial sponsor of the Round.\n\n@_Difint_\nRod Mamin is a systems engineer, with commercial experience building and sending robots to the Moon, Founder of LunCo.Space, Grantee on DeSci & Open Source Software Gitcoin’s GR15, Alpha Round, Beta Round and MoonDAOs Space Engineering Guild Initiator and Ex-Steward.\n\n@PaulBurg_\nPavel Anisimov is an environmental scientist, with experience in public goods and decentralized communities. He is a Blockchain and space enthusiast and Founder of ReFi Phangan (GreenPill local chapter/ReFi DAO hub) and EcoSynthesisX\n\n@Redotics\nRed Boumghar is CEO of Parametry.ai, building SpaceDAO.AI with ESA, and graduated from Creative Destruction Lab.\n\n@Adamjboyle\nAdam Boyle is the founder of SpaceRoxDAO supporting public goods in Space and one of the Core members at Alpha Persei.\n\n**Multi-sig Signers:**\n@IonRod, @ManuelOlariu, @PaulBurg, @Red, @Adam @Ballack\noeth:0xde629289aBfDF973D3b845620Cf40F3c48c9627d\n\n## Estimated Project Timeline: \n- **Aug 3, 2023:** Giveth page created.\n- **Aug 15, 2023:** Min. 25k secured, first Round on Gitcoin announced.\n- **Aug 29, 2023:** End of DeSpace Round.\n- **Sep 15, 2023:** Sybill Analysis & Final results.\n- **Sep 30, 2023:** Grantee Payouts.\n- **Nov 1, 2023 / Ongoing:** Next DeSpace Round.",

          "title": "TE Career Builder for Womxn in Web 3",
          "description": "**What’s our ambition?**\n\nWe are ultimately working towards building a token engineering career building platform serving womxn in web 3, such as:\n\nhttps://www.adaslist.co/\nhttps://www.stemwomen.org.au/\n\nThis platform will serve as a hub for womxn in web 3 looking to build careers in Token Engineering to access an online community, connect with other womxn in web 3 around the world, visualise their career roadmap and feel empowered in their journey to building careers as token engineers.\n\n**Where are we now?**\n\nWe are currently running a study group for womxn in web 3 - bringing together a multi-disciplinary group of female and non-binary budding token engineers. Here is a snapshot of the academic/professional backgrounds of our participants:\n\nData Science - Law - Economics - Development - Innovation Policy - Design - Public Policy - Geography - Software Development - Behavioural Science - Finance - Physics - Maths -Business Development - Accountancy - Cybersecurity\n\nAs part of building our Womxn in Web 3 network, we capture our knowledge, discussions, insights and learnings on a collaborative MIRO board (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJwvJDA=/) and arrange workshops with female and non binary speakers to inspire participants to pursue careers in token engineering. \n\nWe recently conducted a workshop on Empowering Underrepresented Learners in Token Engineering at the recent Token Engineering Barcamp in Paris: https://youtu.be/f6vrvDp5OcQ. \n\nWe represented 1 of 3 sessions delivered by female/non-binary individuals at the event, which had a total of 14 sessions. In this session, we shed light on the barriers faced by underrepresented learners and how we design our study group sessions to combat them:\n\n1. Lack of Role Models\n\n - Arranging specific female & nb speaker sessions.\n - Finding accountability partners within the group.\n\n2. Unequal Digital Literacy\n\n- Designing an accessible/inclusive MIRO structure.\n\n3. Imposter Syndrome\n\n- Including space holding & story sharing time in sessions. \n\n- Co-writing blogs with other participants.\n\n- Using practical case studies to cater for different learner types.\n\n4. Limited Networking Opportunities\n\n- Attending conferences as a group/community.\n\n- Facilitating internship opportunities.\n\n\n**How does the project support Public Goods?**\n\nBringing more female and non-binary voices into Token Engineering will support the development and design of public goods/systems which have a more holistic impact on society. \n\nThese key systems thinking principles highlight why the gender gap impacts the design of public systems:\n\n- **Holism:** The idea that systems are more than the sum of their parts, and should be studied as a whole. This means to understand a system and the actors it serves, the design of the system should be undertaken by the range of actors who will take part. \n\n- **Reflexivity:** The recognition that the observer or designer is part of the system and can influence its behaviour. To have a male-dominated design team will only perpetuate biases in objective setting and incentive design. \n\n- **Perspectives:** The understanding that different people have different perspectives and experiences of a system, and that these perspectives can shape its behavior and outcomes.\n\n**What are the funds for?**\n\nWe are in the research and development stage of platform building. We’d like to formally work on building the study group for cohort 2 and are fundraising for the following:\n\n- 3 days / 24 hours a week \n- 20 weeks (i.e. duration of the cohort Aug - Dec 2023) \n- Rate = 30 USD per hour \n\nTotal cost for 480 hours @ 30 USD p/hour = USD 14,400\n\nAt this stage of our project, we are focusing on these key milestones:\n\n*1. Womxn in Web 3 Skills Showcasing*: writing articles/conducting online speaker sessions.\n\n*2. Career blueprinting*: formalising and visualising more nuanced career blueprints for underrepresented individuals. \n\n*3. Data Collection*: collecting data on the barriers faced by underrepresented groups at different stages of building careers in token engineering.  \n\n*4. POC Development*: building a proof-of-concept for the platform\n\nWe measure success against the following outputs:\n\n*1. Womxn in Web 3 Skills Showcasing*\n- Medium blog with 20 followers. \n\n- 3 Online Events with average attendance of 20 (e.g. Twitter Spaces, Speaker Sessions)\n\n- 2 workshop or speaker sessions on TE delivered by study group participants at in-person conferences/events (e.g. hosted by likeminded projects such as CryptoFemme)\n\n*2. Career Blueprinting*\n- Visual roadmap of a TE career blueprint in infographic form.\n\n*3. Data Collection*\n- Short report on barriers faced by cohort 2 participants in completing TE Fundamentals.\n\n*4. POC Development*\n- Platform Objectives\n- Resources Needed\n- Timeline for development\n- Success criteria\n\nIf we don’t reach this fundraising goal, we will continue to run the study group and build our community. We will aim to focus on activities 2 and 3. \n\nSpecifically, we will aim to gather data on:\n\n- barriers faced with completing the course\n- career trajectories being explored by different womxn in web 3. \n- barriers faced with choosing or following different career trajectories. \n\n**Who is in our team?**\n\nWe are a diverse team from the UK, Germany and Nigeria. We connected over a passion for increasing representation in the space. We bring fresh perspectives from fields of Psychology, Learning and Ecosystem Design, Systems Innovation, Software Development, and Ethical AI. \n\nYou can check us out online:\n\n- Madhuri Rahman -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhuri-rahman - @MadhuriRahman\n\n- Blessing Emah - https://www.linkedin.com/in/blessingemah - @TheblessingEmah\n\n- Lena Hierzi - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lena-hierzi-8221151ab - @Gigahierz\n",

The messages you sign are at once totally unique—there is only one valid signer in the whole world—and yet they can be broadcast many times over, each time accumulating meaning.”*\n\nAnd then asks:\n\n*“Can we create a culture where value is propagated by ongoing response, rather than held captive in possessions?”*\n\n![signature economies](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/700686323950026752/1139497889886908436/signature_economies.png)\n\n# This token engineering research project aims to:\n\n- **explore the possibilities for designing a token able to carry and express symbolic value**\n- **develop open source smart contracts available for the community**\n- **deploy at least one example instance of a SymVal token as a demonstration of its potential**\n\n\n# The path so far:\n\nWe started with the question: **How to code symbolic values in smart contracts?**\n\nInspired by ancient \"technologies\", we are exploring the idea of borrowing concepts and practices from Buddhism, such as prayer wheels, mantras, holy temples / stupas, with the goal of deploying a digital version of them to the blockchain. \n\nTo pursue this idea further, we have started a series of conversations with Marlon Barrios Solano, with the goal of arriving at a token model. \n\nMarlon is a creative technologist and researcher with a background in software engineering, improvisational dance, and embodied awareness, and also a resident meditation teacher and guest movement instructor for Kernel.\n\nAs an early experiment we also asked: \n**Can a token display more than just a balance in a wallet?**\n\nTogether with Simon Wairiuko from the Regro Project we proposed an idea for a token on the NEAR blockchain, taking advantage of the fact their token standard includes an on-chain token icon image supported by the NEAR wallet.\n\nSimon is an artist, farmer and developer, and he created an interactive SVG that shows day/night cycles, a tree's respiration cycle, and localized seasons like Winter and Summer, based on the device’s location and time zone. \n\nThis early experiment dealt only with the token UI display and not yet with the underlying contracts and logic, but was already a step towards the main research question.\n\nThe SVG can be visualized at: https://teia.art/objkt/651699\n\n![Regro interactive SVG](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/921764666567450664/937351385555542026/IMG_5352.jpg)\n\n# Where we are:\n\nWe are currently in the token design phase.

          "description": "The issue of user coordination lies at the heart of blockchain protocol design and financial incentives are one of the means to achieve it. These incentives are threaded in the architecture of the protocol and should enable extensive decentralization among network operators. Several projects have tried to achieve decentralization by employing different models based on financial incentives, each model tailored to the objective function of the protocol. Proof of Work (PoW) and the various iterations of Proof of Stake (PoS) exemplify the incentive models used to align network participants and reach consensus.\n\nPresently, numerous Layer 2 (L2) smart contract platforms built on the Ethereum network compete for market share and aim at network decentralization. In an effort to achieve decentralization within the network and to attract users from the broader ecosystem, these L2 platforms have incentivized usage of their networks through the distribution of their native tokens via 'airdrops'.\n\nOur goal is to build an online dashboard, named Airdrop User Retention Analysis (AURA), that can be accessed for free and could potentially inform incentive design choices for protocols that would consider employing airdrops in the future. Key to the realization of the dashboard is the definition of a metric that evaluates user retention over time on a dollar cost basis. Through the establishment and generalization of this metric, we aspire to devise a framework that facilitates comparisons between the effectiveness of the incentivization strategies employed by different L2 Networks.",

            "answer": "AURA aims to solve the problem of user coordination that lies at the heart of protocol design. We know that financial incentives are one means to achieve it; thus, projects have tried to achieve that coordination by employing different models based on financial incentives, with each model tailored to the objective function of the protocol. Airdrops are one of the most utilized means to attract new users; however, they often fall short in retaining these users after the airdrop event occurs. This effectively undermines the effectiveness of airdrops, as value rapidly flows out of the protocol, resulting in a hidden cost for the protocol.\n\nOur goal is to develop a robust and relevant metric that can assess the average cost for user retention within L2 networks. To achieve this, we will gather data concerning network usage and juxtapose it with the distribution dynamics of each network's native token. Specifically, we aim to analyze how network usage and user behavior fluctuated across different phases of the airdrop distribution.\n\nThe main way for us to determine whether we have accomplished our goal of providing value as a public good will be through monitoring the activity on our website. Once we publish the final version of the dashboard, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our study based on the traffic it receives. We will also offer support to users who would like to delve deeper into the analysis of each protocol's airdrop event, with the hope of informing future airdrop design decisions."

            "answer": "AURA contributes to the token engineering discipline by aiming to demonstrate that \"airdrops are not created equal.\" This means that there can be more and less effective ways of designing airdrop events. Since airdrops are closely tied to the tokenomics of a protocol and its token design, we believe that our study will help shed light on the sustainable design of protocol airdrops and potentially inform future design decisions, resulting in improved effectiveness.\n\nWe will initially focus on L2 protocols, as many projects have launched airdrops in this space, and attempting to capture all of this data would distract us from our main objectives. Once we have covered the L2 protocol space, the next milestone in our roadmap will be to expand to the broader DeFi space.\n\nAURA is considered a public good because it is freely accessible and built openly. This means we will share the analysis behind the creation of the dashboard, allowing projects working on airdrops to find AURA as a valuable resource for consultation. We are committed to keeping the project free and open, which is why we have applied to GR18 to secure a budget that can support our engineering and research efforts in developing AURA."

          "title": "Towards an Industry Standard Python Library for Token Engineering",
          "description": "\n### **Towards an Industry Standard Python Library for Token Engineering Models** \n\n\n### TL;DR\nThis proposal is to fund the joint collaboration between Token Engineering Commons and partner organizations to develop the industry standard token engineering models library using python param. \n\nThis proposal is to fund 6 part time developers for 4 months at a flat rate of $40WXDAI/hour as phase 1 of a 1 year development map.\n \n### Proposal description\nThe idea is to create the industry standard python library for Token Engineering.\n\nSimilar to how [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the industry standard python library for Machine Learning. \n\nThe objective is to produce an interface like the following:\n\n```python\nfrom tec.amm import Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Water\nfrom tec.issuance import AugmentedBondingCurve\nfrom tec.stables import DAI, LAMMA, FRAX\nfrom tec.lending import Aave, Compound\nfrom tec.token import Erc20, Erc721, Erc1155, Erc4626\nfrom tec.voting import Dandelion, ConvictionVoting\nfrom tec.dao import Hatch, Gardens, Safe, Moloch, CulturalBuild\nfrom tec.rewards import Praise, Coordinape\n\ncommons_build_model = Gardens(\n                phase1=CulturalBuild(rewards=Praise(), voting=Dandelion()),\n                phase2=Hatch(\n                        issuance=AugmentedBondingCurve(reserve_ratio=0.65, starting_price=1, starting_supply=1e6),\n                        voting=ConvictionVoting(parameter='supagov'),\n                        liquidity=Water(Uniswap(supply=1e4), supply=1e4),\n                )\n            )\n\ncommons_build_model.view_dashboard()\n#... continue analysis\n```\n\nI propose the use of [python param](https://param.holoviz.org/) to structure the library as hierarchies of parameterized classes. Python param allows python code to offer guarentees to it's users, definining parameters as typed attributes with default values, bounds, and documentation among other qualities like typed dataframes.\n\nOne of the great features of param is that parameterized classes can be automatically visualized in jupyter notebooks or web applications using python panel. This allows custom TE dashboards to be very easily developed as compositions of TE models. To see how param can be used to automatically generate interactive dashboards, see the documentation on [panel param](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Param.html).\n\nYou can read about my opinion on param [here](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/is-param-not-the-most-powerful-python-library-in-existence/385). To get more acquanted with param, I would recommend reading a few pages of [the documentation](https://param.holoviz.org/index.html), particularly interesting is the section about param enabling the [programming of contracts](https://param.holoviz.org/user_guide/Simplifying_Codebases.html#programming-contracts).\n\n\n### Additional information to add\nSome examples of TE models that have already been implemented with Python Param Panel:\n\n* ![Commons Build Hatch Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/f1d583c967cbc4544ded3779b12b4418750ba182.png)\n* ![Augmented Bonding Curve Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/534692fe5a0bc2a2d0a6fc936333453efa35a1d8.png)\n* ![Conviction Voting Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/bb6f444ff97b3b56f667052b6d21dd60a1d61192.png)\n* ![Vyper by Example Models](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5571a0db080f8648a3fa9ebbb8f472136c4dcf22.png)\n* ![Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/75c68a11628586f9f003e2184364265ac0d630a1.png)\n\n\nThe work funded by this proposal would consolidate these models into a single convenient library making them all accessible and combinable from a simple python import. This will establish a single models repository that can attract developers and gain momentum as an open source project.\n\n\n### How does this proposal benefit the community and/or the field of Token Engineering? \n\n* A universal TE models library is exactly what Token Engineers are lacking in their ability to rapidly combine rigorous models in the designs of safe and sustainable token economies. \n* This work will be an attractor that pulls software engineering talent into token engineering. \n* This work will put TEC on the map as a funder and creator of essential token engineering tooling and standards. \n* Having a central repository for these disparate models will create a **schelling point** that will allow the convergence of Token Engineering resources, resulting in a rigorously developed and tested community software package that will continue to flourish over time.\n* This work is compatible and arguably essential to the TokenGaia narrative that is gaining momentum among prominent members of the TEC.\n* This work will allow a standardization and common language around token engineering models.\n* This work is highly complimentary to concurrent TEC initiatives such as the Bonding Curve research group, the TE stakeholder study analysis, and the token engineering academy.\n\n### Amount requested (Only for Conviction Voting)\n* $45KWXDAI for Phase 1\n* 4 months of funding for 6 part time developers\n\n### How will these funds be used? \n* Simple flat hourly rate, $40WXDAI/hour/contributor\n* Total hours available = $45000 / $40 = 1125 hours \n* Target 10 hours/week/contributor\n* 6 contributors * 10  = 60 hours/week total\n* 1125 hours / 60 = 18.75 weeks of runway\n* 18.75 / 4.33 = 4.33 months of runway\n\n* $10,000WXDAI sent as deposit to YGG for a credit of 250 hours as project lead upon passing of the proposal. This will guarantee consistent availability for the duration of the 4 month phase 1 roadmap.  Other members to be distributed monthly at end of month based on hours logged at a maximum of 43 hours per month. \n\n* It's important to note that the proposed budget is very lean. This proposal is open to ideas of expansion, larger funding, funding partners, development partners, and general creative expansions.\n\n### **What does success look like?** \nThis proposal is to fund phase 1 of a one year development roadmap. A successful phase 1 would result in the release of a successful software package that is available to the Token Engineering community for utilization.\n\nPhase 1 Deliverables\n* Stakeholder research to drive library specification\n* Library specification defined\n* Library infrastructure and devops initialized\n* Library MVP initialized\n* Library phase 1 features completed, tested, and documented\n* Project Website and Communication Channel initialized\n* Phase 2 funding strategy complete\n\n### How will you share progress? \n* The community can track the repository progress on Github to see commits, merged pull requests, and updated documentation\n* A project website will be established that contains library documentation\n* TEC Community call updates (Monthly frequency)\n* Twitter Spaces discussions (Semi-Monthly)\n\n### Project information (if applies) \n* No project website yet.\n* This forum post will serve as project website until further notice.\n\n### Team Information \n* [YGG](https://twitter.com/ygg_anderson) (LTF) - Lead developer\n* [BK](https://twitter.com/bgkakadiya) (LTF) - Developer\n* [MD](https://twitter.com/mikedemelo4) (LTF) - Developer in test\n* [Rex](https://twitter.com/tokengineer) (TEC) - Developer\n* Open (TEC) - Developer\n* Open (TEC) - Developer in test\n\n### Complementary information\n\nThe idea of[ producing a universal TE models library](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/universal-python-library-for-te-models/443) has been discussed among the TE community for a long time, but I believe the ecosystem is mature enough now to strike towards the right direction in successfully delivering what is needed by the field.\n\nThis proposal is complimentary to concurrently funded TEC projects such as the Bonding Curve research group, the TE stakeholder study, and the proposed TokenGaia direction of TEC and TEA.\n\nThe availability of such a powerful design and engineering tool for Token Engineers will allow the field to advance rapidly and is essential in the development of safe and sustainable token economies in alignment with the mission of the TEC.",

The total duration of the course is approximately 20+ hours. The voiceover of the course was made in Turkish. As we continue to expand our Solidity course, we would like to announce that this education is supported by the Ethereum Foundation from now on.\n\n--2022-2023 Academic Year Update--\n\nAs with every year, many new members joined us this year. We reserved our first semester in the academic calendar for trainings and meeting with our community. So far, we have held 6 face-to-face trainings, 3 workshops, and 3 meetings between members. In other words, we have done activities in 12 weeks of the 14-week period. We consider it appropriate to share a few images from our events below.\n\n--Devcon VI Bogota--\n\nWe participated in the long-awaited Devcon Bogota as ITU Blockchain. We even had the chance to open Impact Booth at Devcon. All visitors were told about the blockchain community in Turkey and ITU Blockchain. Also, one of our former chairmans, Ulas Erdogan, took part in one of the Devcon panels as a speaker. We also had the chance to talk with Vitalik about the Ethereum community in Istanbul and gift him a t-shirt.\n\n--ETH Berlin & DappCon & DuneCon--\n\nWe attended ETH Berlin with 12 people from our club. We also attended DappCon and DuneCon, which took place as part of the Berlin Blockchain Week, and followed the talks. Our hackathon team placed second in the Open Track category.\n\n--ETH Mexico--\n\nOne of our members participated in ETH Mexico. He and his team became one of 12 finalists. Success continues with ITU Blockchain.\n\n\n\n--ETH Barcelona--\n\nOur teammates took part in ETH Barcelona both as volunteers and as participants. Our volunteer friends have gained a lot of experience on how to organize an event on a global scale. They shared their experiences with us. With these experiences, we will make future events in Turkey better.\n\n--Cryptist Istanbul Meetup--\n\nWe organized and participated in Cryptist Istanbul, the first zero knowledge-focused community event in Turkey. We took part as a team in the event attended by very important speakers and we found various networking opportunities.\n\n--ETH Prague Hackathon--\n\nWe participated in the Ethereum Prague Hackathon with our project on sustainability.

Right after our decision, we are posting our rationales both on Twitter and Governance Forums.\n\nWith our Twitter content, we are keeping our community up to date with situations of the projects of which we are delegating and educating them about token based decentralized governance. Thus, the community has a free and accessible resource on the token-based governance system. Not only that but by providing rationals by creating threads, we aim to show up for the whole community taking part in governance and letting them have another perspective for the proposal in question which in that case, is very valuable for other and especially individual delegates to involve in their decision making process.\n\nBeyond that, we are organizing events and educations about Web3 topics. This topics includes tokeng engineering, and we motivate our members to learn about and work in this area. \n"

Our goal is to use education as a weapon to break a circle of poverty, creating opportunities for income, growth, and sustainable development.  In 2021, Helpers Social Development Foundation establish the Helpers Foundation School in Oji-River, area of Enugu State, Nigeria. The school offers free education for all to date.  \n\n\nThe Challenge\n\n20 million children in Nigeria are out of school due to poverty. Lack of quality education is the primary factor preventing poverty-stricken families from opportunities for growth. Without quality education, the vulnerable will be unable to achieve their potential and end up going into early marriage or facing child labour.  Helpers Foundation school has produced the first pupils who graduated from our school. \n\n\n\nThe Solution\n\nHelpers Foundation school is the solution to prevent children from dropping out of school in Oji-River and will be for thousands of other children in Nigeria. By providing a standard of education for children. Education gives freedom and independence. \n\nAlong with free education, we will be educating children about cryptocurrency. Our curriculum will include setting up wallets, making transactions, NFTs, and some basics about DeFi. We will also be educating them about the dangers and risks of scams and other bad actors.\n\n\nLong-term Impact\n\nQuality education will Helpers Foundation school pupils break a circle of poverty and help support their families. Free school programs give pupils in our school a better opportunity to achieve their potential.\n\n",

          "description": "[![EMPOWER-HERW.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvFZwkfZ/EMPOWER-HERW.png)](https://postimg.cc/f3zTsXgZ)\n\nProject Summary\n\nYour gift will empower women and girls in Nigeria to learn, lead and thrive in our digital world. In Nigeria, more opportunities and resources are needed to ensure that many women and girls gain the digital skills that connect them with greater opportunities, leaving them marginalized and disadvantaged. With your support, we will work to ensure that the women and girls in our programs can access technology and data and receive training to become digitally literate to be valuable members of society. We are Crypto Empowerment Initiative with the aim to empower girls and women through skills acquisition. We have another organization called Helpers Social Development Foundation\n\n\nThe problems\n\nThe gender digital divide is a global issue that negatively affects women and girls everywhere, especially those less privileged and marginalized. Digital exclusion impacts many areas of women's and girls' lives, limiting their access to information and education and equal opportunities to participate in our increasingly digital societies. The COVID-19 pandemic moved many aspects of our lives online, making women and girls' lack of connectivity even more alarming. \n\n\nThe Solution\n\nWith our local partners in Nigeria, we can provide women and girls with access to data and technology and the training they need to become digitally literate. We are building a new computer lab at a local community center where we will have 10 computers. Many women and girls we work with are unemployed and have little or no access to the Internet. Those that do often need to gain the skills to navigate it. Providing women and girls with digital access means that they will stay caught up in their education and will be able to gain the skills they need to develop successful careers.\nAlong with general computer skills we will be educating about cryptocurrency. Our curriculum will include setting up wallets, making transactions, NFTs, and some basics about DeFi. We will also be educating them about the dangers and risks of scams and other bad actors.\n\nThe Long-Term Impact\n\nBridging the digital gender divide is essential to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in our increasingly digital future. Digital literacy has resulted in higher earning potential and greater job opportunities. Women will also be able to access essential tools, how to create cryptocurrency wallets and receive funds. By giving women and girls access to digital resources and the skills to use them, they can gain the power to shape their own futures and influence change in their communities.\n",

          "description": "# What?\n\nToken Trekkers - Trekking around web3 ecosystems 🦒🦓 (@ conferences and summits) Leveling up minds in crypto economic design 👾\n\nThe main goals are to:\n- Provide accessible educational materials\n- Foster engaging and inclusive discourse around crypto economic design and systems\n- Onboard more token engineers to TEA and TEC around the globe\n\n---\n\n# How?\n\nIn 2023, we're attending:\n\n- ETHArgentina\n- ETHGlobal (New York, Lisbon)\n- Cosmos (Istanbul)\n- ETHCollege (Seattle)\n- Funding the Commons & DeSci Summit (Berlin)\n- ETHDenver (Top of mind for next year)\n\nWe can set up events, workshops, happy hours, etc at these conferences. \n\nBeing chapter leads of the GreenPill Network, we can create symbiotic events with established GreenPill chapters. This allows us to educate GreenPill members in researching and building regenerative crypto-economies.\n\nFurthermore, we're partnered with an organization in Nigeria. We'll be traveling there next year to connect with more web3 communities. Africa is prime for web3 mass adoption through education. Currently, half a billion African citizens lack foundational identity, 900 million are under 30, and Central Africa Republic recently made Bitcoin legal tender. Cryptocurrency advocacy is growing, and potential innovators need education to leverage token engineering for their economies.\n\n---\n\n# Proof of Work\n\n## I. Github Tutorials and Guides\n\n\n### A. [Crypto Conductors Web3 Guide](https://github.com/MekailTheMachine/Crypto-Conductors-Guide)\n\nEducates on crypto: computers, solidity, encryption, and DeFi. Incorporates interactive gameplay (capture the flag) to incentivize knowledge solidification in smart contracts.\n\n### B. [Introduction to Encryption in Cryptocurrency](https://github.com/MekailTheMachine/Encryptedkiss)\n\nTeaches the fundamentals of encryption: public keys, private keys, merkle trees, etc., with python code examples.\n\n### C. [ULMFiT Machine Learning Tutorial on Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/0xJade/air-tweets/blob/master/air-sent_analysis.ipynb)\n\nTeaches how to build a machine learning project. Written like a book, covering data cleaning, pre-training, fine-tuning, and classification.\n\n\n## II. Research and Education Presentations\n\n\n### A. [Princeton Plasma Lab - Bubble Oscillations](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArmuhiurceRWqAy1HM7fpyNih7vN?e=Hz9g9M)\n\nResearch and educate peers and professors about applications of electrically-induced bubble oscillations.\n\n### B. [Princeton Plasma Lab - Langmuir Probe](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArmuhiurceRWxl_26fb_8GoUmA98?e=kBT7kj)\n\nResearch and educate about measuring plasma parameters using a Langmuir probe.\n\n\n## III. GreenPill Chapter Kickoffs & Education\n\n\nWe've helped set up chapters in Austin, Denver, Seattle, & Nigeria for GreenPill through traveling to web3 conferences and hosting events for GreenPill education and public goods.\n\n\n## IV. Web3 Wednesdays/Demo Days\n\n\nWe host demo days on our server every other week, showcasing new technologies and educating people on how to interact with them.\n",

This ongoing initiative be viewed at **[permet.co/research](http://permet.co/research)**.\n- Permet onboarded a new team member (who happens to be a black woman) — the team continues to be 100% POC + black-led.\n\n# **WHY?**\n\n## **Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation**\n\nThe apparel and luxury market is growing exponentially: reaching $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.\n\nBut the industry's success is rooted in exploitation. Its business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation**\n\nSlave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands.\n\nThese human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation**\n\nTalented young designers generate massive value for brands - often with little to no compensation.\n\nA successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation**\n\nFashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit.\n\nWhen overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.\n\n# **We’re a black-led team and here’s what we’re working on:**\n\n## **Enabling Profit Redistribution + Transparent Supply Chain + Community Ownership = Human Rights Impact**\n\nPermet recently created the first ever on-chain profit redistribution contract for garment production - redistributing profits from FWB merch sales to supply chain participants.\n\nPermet is looking to build on this by onboarding sewers, pattern makers, printers & other workers from the garment industry who are \"stuck\" working for a factory with no access to profit redistribution - giving them ownership over the value they create.\n\nBuilding cryptographic profit sharing into our tooling enables the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel.\n\nCrypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders:\n\n- Community owned ateliers vs. factories and manufacturers.\n- Fork-able concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.\n- Designs registered as on-chain vectors - enabling proper credit and compensation.\n- Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community.\n- Locally accessible physical design and fashion resources.\n\n## **Building a Transparent Supply Chain**\n\nCreating open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.\n\n## **Creating “Proof of Ethical Production” + Oracles**\n\nEventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.\n\n## **Fighting Fast Fashion = Environmental Impact**\n\nAs a part of our stack - we are working on the first solution for holding fast-fashion polluters accountable.\n\nNow we want to enable supply chain provenance and environmental transparency in the garment production process: create and test the first functional model for an open-source apparel supply chain to show how the garments were produced and the corresponding environmental impacts.\n\n## **Supply Chain Accountability**\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nNow that we’ve experimented with profit redistribution - we want to run experiments to figure out how to capture garment production metadata on chain.\n\nAnd after that - putting these new data capture + manufacturing processes into practice by experimenting with a garment collection that incorporates provenance and accountability around environmental impacts of the collection.\n\nWe hope that our efforts will set precedent and can serve as a model for future apparel projects. The current landscape of crypto fashion is “merch” that encourages wasteful consumption, enablement of existing exploitative power structures, and no regard for the environmental impacts.\n\nPermet seeks to change that by providing an alternative approach that enables sustainability which already reduces waste or gives accountability around environmental impacts of garment production.\n\n## **Open-Sourcing a Model for Ethical Clothing Production**\n\nThis experiment will inform the development of environmental oracles that will allow any apparel project to open-source their environmental impact and adopt new environmental standards - all done via leveraging supply chain metadata arising through the garment production process.\n\nThis supply chain experiment will be done with local supply chain participants in Toronto, Canada - with the hope of subsequently expanding out into other countries.\n\nPermet is creating and open sourcing the first model for a decentralized, transparent supply chain in fashion.\n\n## **How = Utilizing L2s for Real-World Crypto Use Cases**\n\nBlockchain technology is often criticized by naysayers as not having real-world uses.\n\nPermet’s goal of creating an open-source, community-owned supply chain is one of the strongest examples of an IRL use case for crypto.\n\nIn order to create a truly sustainable, community-owned supply chain for clothing, Permet needs to focus heavily on grassroots community work - onboarding sewers, pattern makers, textile producers, and other supply chain participants.\n\nIn many cases - these supply chain participants are members of underrepresented groups: people of color without much exposure to technology - who would be vulnerable to exploitation by traditional fashion industry structures and institutions.\n\nThese participants in the garment supply chain have never heard of blockchain before.\n\nOnboarding them onto Ethereum mainnet - and having them pay anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in gas fees - is simply not feasible for this demographic.\n\nInstead we will work directly with these local supply chain participants to onboard them into crypto via L2s - which can provide an accessible, feasible entry point to these new ecosystem participants.\n\nWe hope to use L2 infrastructure as foundational substrates to build real world utility and onboard new non-crypto native users.\n\nWe will open-source this process to create onboarding resources and serve as a model to other projects who are building real world use cases on L2s - to help accelerate driving real-world adoption.\n\n## **What’s next on the roadmap?**\n\nWe’ve hit our short term goal to use liquid 0xSplits to experiment with redistribution contracts for primary sales for garment workers since the last Gitcoin grants round.\n\nWe seek to build on this success by creating garments made using a transparent supply chain by open sourcing garment production metadata - proving out our model for supply chain accountability.\n\nThrough this process - we will onboard underrepresented communities onto Ethereum L2.\n\nAs mentioned above - we’re working towards a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically, without negative human rights and environmental externalities.\n\nWith an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.\n\nFor a deeper dive into our ecosystem, we invite you to read the first edition of our whitepaper linked on our website: **[permet.co](http://permet.co/)**",

          "description": "WHAT IS CADCAD?\ncadCAD is an open-source Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems through simulation. It is maintained primarily by volunteer efforts by contributors and its creator, Block.Science, an engineering, R&D, and analytics firm specializing in complex systems and operations research. \n\nThe incredibly important modeling and simulation tool is being applied in economic, social and environmental impact R&D, as well as ensuring the safety of new digital public infrastructures including crypto economic systems. (see below article list)\n\nABOUT THIS GRANT\nThanks to your contributions, the cadCAD ecosystem is evolving and expanding — both cadCAD’s core tech and the open source community around it are leveling up! 🤖 However, to bring on a few more much needed roles and continue to grow our model library, we need your continuing support 🙏\n\nWork is steadily progressing on the cadCAD 1.0 reference implementation, that includes a new programming methodology and better organization of code that makes it easier to use and more efficient for systems designers and analyzers.\n\nOn the community side, cadCAD is undergoing registration as a non-profit and preparing bounty programs to seed growth in model testing and development, education and operations. \n\nYour contribution will fund Gitcoin bounties targeted at helping onboard & educate people in the use of cadCAD, to grow the use of this key tool in crypto economic design.\n\nWHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR\ncadCAD's core development has predominantly been funded by BlockScience, and thanks to funding and support from the Token Engineering Commons and Academy, our community has also provided valuable contributions to the ecosystem, helping us improve documentation and educational and supporting materials. We want to take this to the next level by developing a bounty program to accelerate the creation of resources that can help onboard people from different backgrounds to cadCAD, such as:\n\n-Implement a read the docs-like style documentation website\n-Expand the Robot and Marbles tutorial series to cover the full extent of cadCAD's core feature set\n-Build reference system models that explore the full potential of cadCAD\n-Build open source models of general purpose crypto-primitives\n-Explore diagramming options that can help visualize a cadCAD model or plan its implementation\n\n\nHOW YOUR DONATIONS WILL SUPPORT CADCAD\nDonations will go to the cadCAD multisig managed by the volunteer team. The funding will be used to hire primary support roles including a project manager and community management position to design and initialize a bounty program. The BlockScience team and existing cadCAD user community will provide support for new community members engaging through the bounty program, and documentation and direction for this next phase of growth.\n\nCheck out the following articles to discover some of the high impact projects where cadCAD is being applied: \n\nhttps://medium.com/@e4rohan/a-conversion-guide-for-machinations-and-cadcad-ca94ccdea174\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/simulating-the-heights-of-olympus-analyzing-price-stability-in-the-mythic-defi-ecosystem-3237fb1a3996?source=collection_home---4------7----------------------- \n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/testing-armms-in-production-48a08afafdcc\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/complex-systems-modeling-of-community-inclusion-currencies-4e2161787934\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/alpha-bonds-risk-adjusted-bonding-curves-for-financing-impact-5be949fbc5a0?source=collection_home---4------4-----------------------\n\nIf you want to learn more about how and why cadCAD was created, take a look at these posts:\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/introducing-complex-adaptive-dynamics-computer-aided-design-cadcad-38b63b541eb8\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/cadcad-filling-a-critical-gap-in-open-source-data-science-fcd0d3faa8ed\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/announcing-cadcad-1-0-foundations-for-a-new-era-of-open-modeling-ea636b64fda7\n\n\nWe appreciate your donations and support and welcome you to join our community:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cadcad_org/status/1508536504079077386\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/GWPa28k\n\nForum: http://community.cadcad.org/\n\nGithub: https://github.com/cadCAD-org\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/cadcad_org\n\n\n🤖💗\n\n~cadCAD Team & Volunteer Contributors\n\nChris Catoya\nEmanuel Lima\nJoshua Jodesty\nMichael Zargham\nJeff Emmett \nJessica Zartler\n\n",

          "description": "⚔️ The Challenge:\nSustained bear markets have been a huge challenge for token valuations, with many DAOs and organizations seeing massive selloffs and price drops in the 90%+ range. When token price is a primary driver of the capacity to carry out work in a DAO ecosystem, volatile token prices are a hindrance to production in Web3 organizations.\n\n 🚦The Opportunity:\nUsing bonding curves as a continuous token issuance mechanism, organizations or communities can leverage algorithmic reserve and liquidity management strategies to provide volatility-damped token price fluctuations. The Token Engineering Commons Augmented Bonding Curve is a prime example of this, outperforming ETH through the bear market. This should be studied and exemplified in order to broaden education on these tools, and establish connections with organizations who need help designing and deploying them, which could also serve as revenue streams for further work and research.\n\n💪 Seizing the Opportunity:\nThis research group will provide research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms. This research body and content deliverables will attract new talent and interest in the field of Token Engineering, and it will additionally allow for a common understanding and language around bonding curves and their applications to DAOs, businesses, finance, and economics in general. This research could offer improvements for understanding the design and ongoing operation of these new economic mechanisms, benefiting the field of Token Engineering directly through upgraded tools like dashboards and simulators, but also indirectly through networking and deal flow.\n\nBonding curves are an emergent, Web3 native, economic primitive that redefine markets and liquidity. By determining price as proportional to supply, liquidity can be built into an economy, ending the era of market crunches, and enabling transparent and discoverable market prices for assets. The research, development and education in token economic primitives like bonding curves and cutting-edge research in the TE field has profound potential and implications for our economic systems.\n\n⤴️ Overview of Bonding Curves:\nBonding curves are an interesting new tool in the Web3 space, which can provide various automated dealer functions that tie two or more elements of a system together through mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. Also called automated market makers (AMMs), there are different types of bonding curves, including but not limited to constant product, constant function, concentrated liquidity, variable product, time-weighted, and even order book-based bonding curves. Bonding curves have also been ‘augmented’ with the addition of common pool treasuries or even prediction markets, in order to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new tools for social and ecosystemic benefit. \n\nThis is just the beginning of their utility, and current tools have only taken the first steps to explore this design space. Bonding Curves are a gateway for engineered control systems to facilitate and improve the economic management and value accrual systems of Web3.\n\nOur mission is to drive forward the research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms.\n\n🎯 The Purpose of this Research Group:\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a foundation for continuous research, development, and education around bonding curves. Our aim is to establish a deeper understanding of bonding curves in general, and a more thorough analysis of their applications thus far, including the TEC Augmented Bonding Curve. We plan to create a content funnel about bonding curves that educates the wider public and motivates projects seeking bonding curve expertise to connect with our community. This, in turn, will fuel the growth and development of the bonding curve space while providing economic opportunities to those involved with developing bonding curves for projects.\n\n⚙️ Continuous Development and Research Methodology:\nIt is worth noting that research initiatives are fundamentally different from development processes, which is one reason we are proposing this as a research ‘marathon’ work, as opposed to more task-based ‘sprints’ commonly held on faster time cycles among development teams. Research is fundamentally an exploratory exercise, often without clear outcomes at the outset of the initiative. For that reason, we will set deliverables such as content production timelines and hours input into processes as they’ve been laid out, rather than trying to determine ahead of time the exact topics or outcomes produced by the end of this first research marathon.\n\n📚 Past Work & Achievements : \nThe BCRG was founded in March 2023  and has three operational workstreams including Education & Content, Research & Ideation and Bonding Curve Analysis & Modeling.

Bonding Curves Parameters Model - https://github.com/bonding-curves/conding/blob/main/conding/pamm/abc.py\n7. Token Engineering Commons Dune Dashboard & Python Translation - https://dune.com/rxx_/bondingcurves\n\n💸 Past Funding : \nWe applied and received catalytic funding from the Token Engineering Commons and Gitcoin, however we need further funding to continue in Phase 2 of our research and development so are currently applying for grants. \n\n🎖️ What Success Looks Like:\n1. Social media content posts, digestible and thought provoking\n2. Posts have community traction, bringing in new leads and interest into the TEC\n3. Improved methodology for analyzing Bonding Curves on-chain data\n4. Explore new bonding curve mechanisms and shed light to the creators of the provisions to include in their bonding curve : Shutdown & Liquidation Procedures, Develop gamified UX visualizations of the Bonding Curve where members can play with the parameter to see the final impact. \n5. Other unanticipated positive externalities discovered through research\n6. We would like to use our research to ultimately develop a Product & Services Business Model around Bonding Curves and are also going to experiment with launching our own investable workstream and bonding curve with Inverter Network. \n\n🔊 How We Will Share Progress:\n1. Transparent shared work processes (call notes, Miro board, call recordings as available)\n2. TEC forum announcements every third week, with links to posts & other work\n3. Scheduled interest group in the TEC Discord at the completion of the research marathon\n4. Deliverable outputs (videos, tweets, articles, etc) will be shared with the TEC community and beyond\n\nThank you for supporting Token Engineering public goods and the Bonding Curve Research Group! 🙏",

          "description": "Community-bound Tokens (CBTs) are modified ERC-20 tokens that can only be transferred among members of a community, which can be used for reputation, community merit based governance, opt-in social credit score, coordination games or engagement scores.\n\nCommunity-bound Tokens (CBTs) are tight to a specific community of members (or a group of addresses), as defined by mathematics (cryptographically) through for example memberships of a multi-signature wallet, an ERC-721 or a membership Soulbound token.\n\nThe philosophy behind it is, that although Soulbound NFTs can be used as badges, it's hard to quantify them for reputation, and mostly require more work, since they need to be done one by one.\n\nCBTs allow communities to decide how much they value certain actions and how many reputation points they attach to them. Preferably these actions are onchain so the CBTs can be dropped automatically to the earners, but they can also be off-chain by allowing the community to give CBTs retroactively based on a performed activity in the real world. Later on, these tokens can be used as a merit-based governance, for reputation, as a community credit score for under-collaterlised loans, or any creative ways the community can think of.\n\nFor this specific example project, with which we were finalists at ETHGlobal Paris, we forked a Safe{Wallet} and added a social layer to it. The purpose was to showcase how you can attach a specific value of CBTs to specific actions inside a Safe, and make a multi-sig more engaging to interact with by adding a Feed/Chat and reputation points to the proposed actions. When a proposal is passed, the proposer receives the reputation points (RP) that are attached to these specific types of proposals. They can range from proposing a new member, to proposing swaps, buying an ENS, or putting the community treasury to generate yield.\n\nSince the creation of the Community-bound tokens a couple of weeks ago, another team built another use-case around it for the Superhack, and we received a lot of interest from web3 communities who want to implement this to measure the engagement of their members, and gamify their communities\n\nHow it's Made:\nWe modified two parameters of the standard ERC-20 token to make it transferable to only a whitelist of addresses that comes, for example, from a Safe.\n\nThe deployed ERC-20 can only be ownable by community members, which in this case can only be added by the Safe multi-sig owner (the Safe itself). The functions mint() and transfer() can only be executed by the members of that community.\n\nWe forked Safe{Wallet} and integrated Push Chat into it. We then used Hardhat to deploy our custom made ERC-20 Community Bound Token to Sepolia, Linea, Gnosis Chain, Mantle, Zetachain and Celo.\n\n",
