          "title": "Dynamic Optimization Algorithm for Self-regulating Tokenomics",
          "description": "Most tokenomics policies today (e.g. inflation rate, burning rate) are either coded statically or rely on DAO governance for adjustments. This approach ensures decentralization, but the lack of real-time response mechanisms also make the tokenomics vulnerable to the impact of external shocks, such as a large price movements and hacks.\n\nHow do we design tokenomics that is robust against these shocks, while preserving decentralization? The bold yet rational answer is: let a bot run the economy.\n\nIn this research project, my aim is to build an autonomous algorithm that regulates a blockchain economy with two key parameters: staking rate and burning rate. In particular, I apply a modeling tool from modern macroeconomic theory called DSGE, which is the gold standard used by central banks worldwide to determine key economic parameters like interest rates. Cutting-edge data science tools such as machine learning and causal inference models will be applied in the calibration process. This research will provide guidance for the new generation of protocol tokenomics.\n\n**About the researcher**\n\nMy name is Ming and I am a graduate student and researcher at UChicago studying computational economics. I've worked as a research fellow at Nethermind and DeFi research analyst at Polygon. You can learn more about me and my previous work at https://sites.google.com/view/mingxuanhe\n\n**Improvements on existing approaches**\n\nThe idea of optimizing burning and staking using dynamic modeling tools has seen growing exploration recently (e.g. @urosnoetic's post about BME in the previous round of TE grants, and multiple papers from the economics/finance literature in 2022/2023). My novelty is to develop a fully testable, calibratable model that also addresses uncertainty and lack of information. I also address key concerns such as algorithmic bias and systemic economic inequalities.\n\n**Current state**\n\nI have formalize the baseline model (Biais et al, 2020) in the context of tokenomics, and I'm currently in the phase of building the full model. [Presentation slides](https://github.com/mingxuan-he/dp-tokenomics/blob/master/Presentations/pitch_slides.pdf) can be found under the project github repo. The slides summarizes the current state of the research project, include a detailed introduction for the project, literature review, some technical components, and next steps.\n\n**Expected outcome**\n\nThe expected result is a complete MA thesis paper (15-30 pages) which will go under the review of a graduate research committee at University of Chicago Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics. \nThe end goal is to publish the paper in a peer-reviewed journal or conference. Before publication, I will open source the working paper and any relevant code on Github. The project is expected to take 4-5 months, with an upper limit of 8 months.\n\n**Funding Usage**\n\nAs an international student in the US, it is extremely difficult to receive academic scholarships and research funding because of my foreign status. That's why I turned to this community of fellow builders for help. Funding from this grant would help me cover part of my advanced studies in computational economics as well as some paid research tools. Here's a plan on how the funding will be used on this project:\n- Data: will try to use public data for initial stages, but later stages likely requires subscription-based APIs or databases (~$50/month * 5 months)\n- Computational resources: I will need to use credit-based computing services such as AWS or the Midway Cluster for running large-scale computation and machine learning models. An example can be found at https://github.com/mingxuan-he/eth-fee-time-series (~$80/month * 5 months)\n- Journal/conference submission & traveling expenses (~$1000)\n- Total: ~$1650\nAny additional funding will be directed towards creating more accessible community content such as explainers, blog posts, and open-source widgets.",

          "description": "## Introduction\nWhen you step into ChainPray, this unique blockchain prayer platform, you will discover **a world full of warmth and care**. Unlike those projects solely focused on wealth and profits, ChainPray chooses to turn its attention to ordinary users in the cryptocurrency community who have been affected by hackers, bad actors, and liquidations, providing them with heartfelt spiritual support to make them feel truly cared for and supported.\n\nChainPray ingeniously blends traditional prayers with advanced blockchain technology. On this magical platform, every user has the right to **claim one \"PrayLuck\" (PrayLuck Coin) for free every day**. By activating the daily prayer feature, users receive blessings from the blockchain, starting their day with positivity and goodness. This precious gift allows you to feel the platform's thoughtfulness and care.\n\nIn addition, ChainPray offers many exciting and meaningful additional features, such as \"**Destiny Pray**\", \"**GoodMan Contributions**\", \"**God Competitions**\", and \"**Sunny Award**\". These features not only add fun but also make you experience the colorful and wonderful aspects of life.\n\n## Token Pass System\nChainPray's token economy consists of two tokens, **PrayLuck** and **PrayLuckStar**, along with the issuance of **NFTs** with different attributes. PrayLuckStar is obtained by users through the probability of \"Destiny Pray\", and the more times users pray, the more accumulated luck they have, making it easier to obtain PrayLuckStar. ChainPray also releases NFTs with various attributes to help users acquire PrayLuckStar more easily. For detailed information, please refer to the TokenPlan section on the [ChainPray official website](https://chainpray.com).\n\n## Profit and Rewards\nChainPray's mission is not limited to providing spiritual support to cryptocurrency users. During the project's operation, **DAO will regularly distribute the \"Sunny Award\" of PrayLuck to random ChainPray users**. This portion of PrayLuck comes entirely from users' prayer consumption, reflecting a concept of \"**taking from the people, giving back to the people.**\" In the later stages of the ChainPray project, PrayLuckStar obtained through Destiny Prayers will have various consumer use cases, such as purchasing advertising space on ChainPray, issuing chain-wide announcements, buying unique NFTs, and more. Therefore, ChainPray will generate profits, and **the DAO will continue to use a significant portion of the profits to carry out \"Sunny Award\" for random ChainPray users**.\n\n## Team\nChainPray's backend team boasts 5 years of experience in the internet industry and **5 years of experience in blockchain development**. Additionally, the smart contract development team has **4 years of experience specifically in Ethereum smart contracts**. The smart contracts used by ChainPray are developed using **Solidity**, ensuring simplicity and have undergone a thorough audit by multiple seasoned smart contract developers with years of experience in the cryptocurrency community. This ensures that **there are no contract security issues present**.\n\n## Invitation card\nWe sincerely invite you to personally experience the unique charm of ChainPray and let your soul be nurtured and enlightened. ChainPray looks forward to sharing unforgettable moments with you, creating beautiful and heartwarming memories together. On this platform filled with blessings and care, let us embark on an unforgettable journey together.",

          "description": "**Fau0x Salon Governance RPG Card Deck**\n\nWe at the 0x Salon have developed a non-Web3-specific card game (Fau0x Salon, 2021) which serves as a discursive tool for participants to role-play post-disciplinary conversations from a variety of perspectives. The card deck \"pops-up\" salon-style events (intimate and diverse peer-group discussions) with some facilitation, allowing participants to role-play through problems, topics, and governance tensions from the perspectives of fictional character archetypes rather than themselves. We have been invited to present the Fau0x Salon project in an exhibition in Switzerland in November. The 2021 version of the card deck is here: https://www.are.na/0x-salon/wip-salon-deck-v2\n\nWe would like to prepare a Web3-specific version of this card deck, and seek contributions to help us with R&D, design, playtest, and production costs. Our goal is to complete a new version of the deck, do a series of playtests and workshops at Web3 events, make many hard copies available, and open-source the deck so that anyone can print their own copy and play.\n\nIn a way, we are developing a \"Web3 governance therapy tool\" ﻿🚀﻿. One problem we are trying to solve is around the 'eternal September' problem of welcoming new people into the Web3 ecosystem with nuanced and unbiased information. There's also a related challenge, in the 'governance' of the human organisations that necessarily form around decentralised protocols, such as foundations, startups, benefactors, investors, as well as developers, miners / validators / service providers, users, …. Due to the complex balance of stakeholder incentives in Ethereum and other Web3 networks, individual stakeholders may not be incentive-aligned, which can lead to “off-chain tensions” or even adversarial behaviour that is detrimental to the protocol.\n\nDue to these somewhat split loyalties, and the distributed nature of many Web3 project teams, time spent together IRL (where communication is most effective) is scarce. Having a “governance RPG” as a tool for teams to role-play through scenarios would enable team members to work through points of tension, without bringing their own personal characters or desiderata into the equation.  \n\n**About the 0x Salon**\n0x Salon is a collective endeavour which critically interrogates digital culture — primarily that of the blockchain community — through discourse events and residencies, producing scholarly and creative interventions in the process. \n\nSince 2020, we have been hosting salons ⁠— intimate post-disciplinary discussions ⁠— on a range of conversation topics. We are conducting an ongoing, non-profit experiment in knowledge sharing and collective cultural production. \n\nStewarded by 0x Salon team members, our community researches topics, organises events, and produces lore, critical theory, poetry, philosophy, games, theatre, and visual art. Our website principally functions as a transmedia archival space, chronicling discussions within the 0x Salon and the resulting activities.",

Since 2020, we have been hosting salons ⁠— intimate post-disciplinary discussions ⁠— on a range of conversation topics. We are conducting an ongoing, non-profit experiment in knowledge sharing and collective cultural production. Stewarded by 0x Salon team members, our community researches topics, organises events, and produces lore, critical theory, poetry, philosophy, games, theatre, and visual art. Our website principally functions as a transmedia archival space, chronicling discussions within the 0x Salon and the resulting activities.\n\n///\n\nWassim Z. Alsindi PhDWassim is the founder and creative director of the 0x Salon, which conducts experiments in post-disciplinary collective knowledge practices. A veteran of the timechain, Wassim specialises in conceptual design and philosophy of peer-to-peer systems, on which he writes, speaks, teaches, and consults. He has an editorial column at the MIT Computational Law Report, and he co-founded MIT’s Cryptoeconomic Systems journal and conference series. Wassim has curated arts festivals, led a sculptural engineering laboratory and published experimental music, satirical theatre, poetry, and speculative scripture.

One problem we are trying to solve is around the 'eternal September' problem of welcoming new people into the Web3 ecosystem with nuanced and unbiased information. There's also a related challenge, in the 'governance' of the human organisations that necessarily form around decentralised protocols, such as foundations, startups, benefactors, investors, as well as developers, miners / validators / service providers, users, …. Due to the complex balance of stakeholder incentives in Ethereum and other Web3 networks, individual stakeholders may not be incentive-aligned, which can lead to “off-chain tensions” or even adversarial behaviour that is detrimental to the protocol.\n\nDue to these somewhat split loyalties, and the distributed nature of many Web3 project teams, time spent together IRL (where communication is most effective) is scarce. Having a “governance RPG” as a tool for teams to role-play through scenarios would enable team members to work through points of tension, without bringing their own personal characters or desiderata into the equation.

Pulling data from our first API, we have built our database, and are reviewing the data we have pulled to determine its usefulness and accuracy.\n\nWe will begin to build the automated agent that serves to construct our curated datasets and update them automatically every 30 days for Ocean Marketplace.\n\nWe will sell our datasets on Ocean Marketplace for very low prices.  Once the PoC has been validated, we will apply for a grant via Ocean Protocol Shipyard.  With additional funds, alongside tapping into more API's and building more curated datasets, we will  build an AI Model that will allow subscribers to query the datatsets and derive insight from them. (see #3 in Growth Strategies below)\n\n### **Target Audience:**\n\nData scientists (specifically web3 for MVP)\n\nAI Builders\n\nToken Engineers\n\n**The Problem(s):** \n\nExisting on-chain data providers offer data through APIs:\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Require technical expertise to use (can be a barrier for others that lack technical expertise)\n- Data is often raw and unfiltered\n- Time-consuming to extract meaningful insights (This can involve cleaning the data, dealing with missing or inconsistent data, aggregating data, calculating metrics, and so on. ) Can be a barrier for those that lack time\n\n### **DataBites Benefits:**\n\n1.

          "description": "[EVMcrispr](https://evmcrispr.com) is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify interactions with smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains. **It enables users to send transactions using intuitive, UNIX-like commands**, allowing for the creation of complete scripts that perform multiple arbitrary actions from the injected wallet in the web browser. This makes it easier to write complex scripts for various day-to-day blockchain operations, such as creating efficient DAO votes, launching and managing DAO configurations, performing DeFi strategies, running simulations on drafted on-chain actions, and creating, sending, and managing tokens.\n\nEVMcrispr effectively lowers the technical barriers for web3 users to engage in and execute complex tasks using smart contracts. The tool's **domain-specific language is useful for expressing and transforming transaction data**. It has been adopted by organizations like Curve, Aragon, NFTX, 1Hive, Giveth, TECommons, BrightId, and Agave to conduct intricate votes within their Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nThe tool boasts a terminal-like interface, complemented by clear documentation and numerous examples, making it easy for users to start. **It eliminates the need for a customized frontend to interact with Ethereum**, as users can simply write and share scripts with others for execution.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are examples of scripts that perform day-to-day ENS actions. You can find more examples on how to use EVMcrispr [in the documentation](https://evmcrispr.com).\n\n\n#### How to set an avatar image for your ENS\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZR6ekSW.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.eth.limo/#/terminal/QmU6fkoE2sRXCqtDSy7ZcZu3wefq3XxwpSy5BH2juyRdT1)\n\n\n#### How to set a lockup address\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jsTsO6o.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.com/#/terminal/QmU8rZYn3azqEvVHX3KGAh9i8fMfLdnp8r5QegosZCThuN)\n\n\n#### How to extend an ENS domain for 1 year\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7EdnXXc.png)\n\n[Open the terminal](https://evmcrispr.com/#/terminal/QmNvK7tRpBjh8Q11hZ9Rs8e477R2Wc8dSpbzPXqEXABXNG)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nEVMcrispr is committed to continuous improvement and expansion of its features. The following next steps have been identified to enhance the tool and user experience:\n\n1.  **Bug fixing and improved error messages:** Addressing and resolving any existing issues or bugs in the current implementation, ensuring a seamless user experience. We are dedicated to refining error messages to better inform users about potential issues and failures.\n2.  **Formal language specification:** Developing a well-defined and comprehensive formal language specification to provide clear guidance for users and facilitate future improvements. The language specification will also be useful for LLMs to program transactions properly.\n3.  **Event handling and output integration:** Implementing event handling capabilities to enable better tracking and monitoring of smart contract events and transactions. The outputs of the events will be made available in the script to inform and initiate subsequent transactions.\n4.  **Safe support:** Integrating support for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), a widely-used smart contract wallet, to further broaden EVMcrispr's compatibility and utility for users within the ecosystem.\n5.  **Improved ENS support:** EVMcrispr will make ENS names first-class citizens of the domain-specific language. The tool already supports the `namehash` function, and the `contenthash` function will be added to enhance ENS-related capabilities.\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, EVMcrispr aims to become an even more versatile and valuable tool for interacting with smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains.\n\nThe source code for EVMcrispr can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/EVMcrispr/evmcrispr) under the GPLv3 license.",

          "description": "HarbergerToken is an innovative open-source project token solution based on blockchain technology that aims to address the long-standing sustainability issue faced by open-source communities. Anyone, including the open-source project owner, can create an HBG Token for any open-source project. Through the tax mechanism and risk-free mortgage feature, HBG Token provides a mutually beneficial ecosystem for open-source projects and investors. __Core features include risk-free mortgage, high capital utilization (up to 60x for early buyers), and the tax mechanism.__\n\nThe tax rights are assetized into two types of NFTs: Create NFT and Owner NFT. Create NFT has a 5% tax allocation right obtained by the person who creates the HBG Token (the creation price is GitHub stars multiplied by 0.1 $FIND; open-source project owners can create for free). Owner NFT has a 95% tax allocation right, and open-source project owners can claim it for free. The income before the Owner NFT is claimed belongs to the platform.\n\n![NFT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105170140/231097911-4baa40b0-667d-418b-9d9b-b9a0afc81c7c.jpg)\n\nHBG Token adopts an issuance method without reservation, where all tokens are placed in the Uniswap pool and cannot be withdrawn. This issuance method makes the liquidity more secure, and there is no liquidity risk.\n\nThe risk-free mortgage feature of HarbergerToken allows users to borrow $FIND & $ETH tokens by mortgaging HBG Tokens, which enables low-risk capital gains. For early buyers, HarbergerToken can also provide up to 60x capital utilization, greatly improving the efficiency of capital utilization. This efficient capital utilization not only reduces investors' risks but also creates more value for open-source projects.\n\nIn summary, HarbergerToken is committed to providing continuous financial support for open-source projects while also providing investors with a highly promising trading asset. Through risk-free lending, high capital utilization, and innovative tax mechanisms, HarbergerToken becomes an ideal bridge between open-source projects and investors.\n\n### links\n\nWebsite:  https://harberger.money/\nVideo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs5WH582Llo\nWhitepaper:  https://medium.com/@HarbergerToken/0xfind-whitepaper-en-8fca1e0b94a5\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/YQzvAGkqcg\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/HarbergerToken\nGithub:  https://github.com/0xfind\n",

Our token issuance mechanism, especially with the creation of two NFTs (Create NFT and Owner NFT) representing tax collection rights, is a pioneering step in the blockchain space. By leveraging Uniswap V3 features, we've successfully implemented a risk-free lending function, eliminating issues like the death spiral. This no-risk, no-interest, no-liquidation lending offers up to 67x capital efficiency, potentially jump-starting open-source projects.\nFurthermore, our project inherently promotes a positive-sum game, where the HBG token's price reflects the community's consensus on an open-source project. This financial motivation encourages active community participation in testing, documentation, sharing, and even operations, resulting in a closely-knit community.\nIn essence, HarbergerToken not only pushes the envelope in token engineering but also fosters community building, collaboration, and sustainable growth in open-source projects. As a public good, it offers both tangible financial incentives and intangible social benefits to its community."

          "description": "# on-chain realtime hack prevention\n\n### we are building on-chain firewalls\n\n---\n\n## What is an On-Chain Smart Contract Firewall?\n\nSmart contract hacks have been plaguing DeFi protocols, bridges, and more.\n\nToday, in order to defend themselves, protocols perform audits, open bug bounties, and implement monitoring.\n\nAll of these steps are absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.\n\nYou can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.\n\nOur Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:\n\n- Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.\n- Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).\n- Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.\n\nThe Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.\n\n---\n\n## Our Roadmap\n\n### **Phase 1: Research & Proof-of-Concept**\n\n- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th August 2023\n\nThis phase will focus on in-depth research and the creation of proof-of-concepts demonstrating how tailored firewall can enhance the security and functionality of protocols.\n\n### Milestone 2: Prototyping & Production\n\n- **Estimated Duration:** 2 Months\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th October 2023\n\nThe second phase will concentrate on the development and testing of firewall prototypes based on the findings of the first phase. The prototypes will showcase the practicality and benefits of integrating on-chain firewalls into DeFi Protocols.\n\n### Milestone 3: Testnet Deployment\n- **Estimated Duration:** 1 Month\n- **Estimated delivery date:** 30th November 2023\n\n## The final phase will involve the testnet deployment of all firewall components, followed by rigorous testing and refinement to ensure the system is ready for potential mainnet audits and protocol implementations.\n\n## **Our Goals**\n\n- Reliability\n- Inexpensive in gas terms. The overhead must remain negligible.\n- Not adding complexity to the protected contract(s): Implementing the Firewall must not require more than a few lines of Solidity code.\n- It must scale\n\n---\n\n# TL;DR ⤵️\n\n## **How Does It Work?**\n\n**You can track any critical metric that could be indicative of an exploit happening for your protocol.**\n\n### Let's take the example of TVL:\n\nEvery time there is an inflow or outflow of liquidity, you add a call to the Firewall contract to track the TVL at this point in time within your protocol. The Firewall will keep a history of your TVL over time.\nThis allows you to define a threshold so that if more than X% of the TVL exits the protocol in less than Y number of blocks, the Firewall triggers.\nWhen this happens, the Firewall status is updated before the transaction is committed, which allows you to implement a set of defensive strategies to prevent the transaction from going through, such as rejecting the transaction or freezing the funds.\n\nAll of this happens synchronously, at the contract level in Solidity. This means that exploits are prevented from happening automatically, and directly on-chain.\n\nYou can find a more detailed explanation of the Firewall [here](https://turtleshell.gitbook.io/introduction/how-it-works).\n\n### **Protective Measures**\n\nOnce the Firewall gets triggered, protocols can use it in various ways to protect their assets. Here are some of the protective measures that can be taken:\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/56e03ba6-c890-4df6-8063-6b922adce341/firewall_triggered.svg?id=0df407f8-b92c-40bd-bbb0-27c2d94cb8f2&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691712000000&signature=4DUMvFXQlMfGejNNjJNO3gfV2P985i2wzAOK2NnxRic&downloadName=firewall_triggered.svg)\n___\n## **Implementation and Integration**\n\n1. **Setup configuration**: Define the parameter you want to track (e.g: TVL) and a maximum threshold that should not be reached within a custom time period.\n2. **Identify Entry Points**: This step consists of listing functions that affect your parameter. For TVL, that would be functions that increase or decrease liquidity (e.g., deposit & withdraw).\n3. **Integrate the Firewall**: For each entry point, you must add a single line of code to call the Firewall to track this parameter.\n4. **Choose and Implement a Defensive Strategy**: Every time you call the firewall, it returns its status. If the firewall triggers, you implement one of our strategies: reject transaction, freeze funds, pause protocol, etc.\n5. **Monitor and Adjust**: After integration, you can monitor the operation of the firewall and adjust the parameters as needed. This allows you to fine-tune the system to better protect your protocol.\n\nRemember, the key to effective use of the Firewall is understanding your protocol's specific needs and adjusting the parameters accordingly. With the right configuration, the Firewall can provide a robust line of defence against potential hacks and unauthorized fund withdrawals.\n\n### What does a Solidity integration look like?\n\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw(uint256 withdrawAmount) external override {\n\t[...]\n\t// Firewall implementation\n\tbool firewallTriggered = IFirewall(firewall).decreaseParameter(withdrawAmount);\n\tif (firewallTriggered) return;\n\t[...]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Why it is important what we build\n\nMost established exploit prevention procedures like performing security audits are important, yet, we must understand that these have limitations and cannot asses risks beyond code produced by the engineering team. External dependencies as potential attack vectors are frequently being disregarded or *assumed* to be safe, as they lies outside a single protocol’s spectrum of actionable security measures. Given the example of the most recent curve exploit: Auditing legacy versions of the Vyper compiler, was undoubtably out of the protocol’s security scope.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/85dbe180-0f88-43d0-b684-3f5ddc7ee6d7/no_firewall.svg?id=2fd27862-22c1-449b-81bf-c117ffccb8d1&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=PS-S6gi09av2Uy1msnYxh3AwuDbYIgL69Ki0CaGgYks&downloadName=no_firewall.svg)\n\nEven when exploring hypothetical scenarios, e.g.: All protocols using Vyper coming together beforehand and collectively sourcing audits for Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0, it still would not have solved the underlying problem: The *unknown (un)knowns* of vulnerable external dependencies. Given the infinite amount of unknowns, it is merely impossible to effectively draw the line between where to start and stop security audits.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/abea7062-fba8-4f89-a092-2bd3acc966a9/no_firewall_cycle.svg?id=7c4d140d-5252-4bdb-9b52-87f9d0b3d111&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=AsCb8siZEWEKliqMvSBaoxR5475sCUusyNiHfVYeEHk&downloadName=no_firewall_cycle.svg)\n\nThis is why protocols have to hope for the best while keeping their fingers crossed🤞once deploying code to production. In essence: Hoping they won’t have to face any *unknown (un)knowns* in production, but if so, hopefully only through bug bounties programs and whitehats. Usually, the financial incentives for blackhat hackers largely outweigh bug bounty initiatives, leading to exploits of undiscovered attack vectors. Furthermore, in accordance to Murphy’s Law, the above strategy would lead to a hack in any case, sooner or later.\n\n---\n\n## Actionable opportunities to protect the protocol\n\n### Adding Firewalls to the protocols production deployments\n\nAs an additional layer of protection to the protocol Firewalls can be added to mitigate in-production risks.\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/d657a457-f1ff-466e-9fda-834e5e2b6960/firewall_cycle.svg?id=d1fea3f9-a839-40f7-8e72-4dcc0498d5e8&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=Y4vDfcAEbwx3fLlS0yTAleP-XeC7qrADIJVLCKWOn8I&downloadName=firewall_cycle.svg)\n\n***Even tough, the way the protocol gets exploited relies on an unknown (un)known, the target of the exploit always is a KNOWN KNOWN, being liquidity.***\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/cd611ba0-e6e6-44e4-a1c4-092a1877ed5a/unknown.svg?id=d9fd796b-f684-407b-a9ab-785bf935a8fc&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=Rs29pxwyQ4EgZG8_SRs_YACvA148i-9veTuyPF15XMY&downloadName=unknown.svg)\n\n**→ Therefore, we can work with the known characteristics of every exploit happening, instead of trying to solve what we cannot know.**\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/9718190a-5d8d-4a1a-8247-bf489d4d1dc8/known.svg?id=ac678746-28bf-476b-a468-33cfd9666b0d&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=qYYMfTnH_9NG-nOIhB7OW1KUd9pdzw-cqtipj4sHQxM&downloadName=known.svg)\n\nWe are aware of the attackers target: extracting Liquidity.\n\nWe are aware of external dependencies, will most likely lead the attacker to his target.\n\n***→ knowing and understanding these two crucial pieces of information, we can design a security system around these two vectors.***\n\n![](https://file.notion.so/f/s/a001b4cf-e63b-4571-a210-9aa9c2f0014b/firewall.svg?id=28da97a7-5a30-4082-a7fb-3614752aa556&table=block&spaceId=549a06fc-7073-4a4a-a8f1-3206b15135b8&expirationTimestamp=1691683200000&signature=0wuyiOSBTjiTbHH2yNWtAeakYUduNI0-zZumI-bavD0&downloadName=firewall.svg)\n\nAs a wrapped layer of security around the protocol, the attacker will not be able to reach his intended target: *extracting liquidity*, with *external dependencies* as his attack vector. Even when vulnerabilities occur (e.g. faulty compilers), an attacker will not reach his target, as the Firewall system operates as an independent layer of security for the protocol.\n\nWhenever abnormal activity occurs, on-chain Firewall’s offer a range of protective measures, including blocking of transactions, pausing the protocol, freezing of funds, or controlled fund withdrawal, thereby providing a robust on-chain defence against potential hacks.\n\n## Resources:\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turtleshell_xyz)\n- [Team’s Website](https://turtleshell.xyz/)\n- [Docs](https://turtleshell.gitbook.io/)\n- [Team’s Github Organization](https://github.com/ikigai-labs-xyz/turtleshell-core)\n- [Demo Repository](https://github.com/ikigai-labs-xyz/turtleshell-core)\n- [relevant Firewall Demo of a L&B Market](https://www.loom.com/share/f6981c21abd54afc8b29565de1d3ea3a?t=2)",

Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.\n\nYou can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.\n\nOur Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:\n\n- Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.\n- Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).\n- Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.\n\nThe Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.\n\n___\n\nWe'll know our project was a success when we observe increased adoption rates, reduced security incidents in the token ecosystem, and receive positive feedback from the community, signaling enhanced trust and robustness in the DeFi space.\n\nBest case scenario:\n\nA protocol is under attack, but was able to block the attack with the firewall integration."

          "description": "# 💡TL;DR\n\nHelp us enable more communities to fund and govern their mission! With Gitcoin donations, we will continue **providing blueprints and tools for impact communities to realize economic sustainability and shared resource governance**.\n\nLeveraging our success with the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436) and [Economic Co-design](https://medium.com/commonsstack/a-non-violent-revolution-against-technocracy-53388b123936) for the [Token Engineering Commons (TEC)](https://tecommons.org/), we aim to further enable more communities to launch their own economies by refining, documenting, and promoting our open-source tools and protocols for creating **sustainable token economies and equitable governance system**. \n\nDonate to Commons Stack and support our solutions for funding, governance and public goods management.\n\nThank you for your generosity! 🙏\n\n\n# 🌎 ABOUT COMMONS STACK\n\nWe innovate at the intersection between culture and token engineering!\n\nCommons Stack builds technical tools and cultural frameworks that enable impact initiatives to evolve into decentralized, regenerative, self-governing communities. Our expertise lies in guiding communities through the process of creating an organizational structure that facilitates active participation, cooperation, and accountability. You can build a community-driven ecosystem that fosters positive change and ensures your project’s long-term success.\n\nThese four pillars present our approach to funding, governance, and public goods management:\n\n**Cultural frameworks:**  We provide comprehensive cultural frameworks that empower impact-focused communities to form, fundraise, and govern effectively, ensuring their long-term success. These frameworks are designed to accommodate the unique needs and challenges of DAOs, offering flexible, research-based solutions that respect both collective and individual autonomy.\n\n**Economics Co-design:** We champion Economic Co-design, a methodology that promotes inclusion, transparency, and active participation, enabling community members to create their own economic design proposals. This ensures diverse perspectives are heard, fostering the growth of innovative and practical solutions tailored to community needs through a 3-step process: educate, propose, and vote.\n\n**Research:** We conduct research to innovate collective governance and economic design tools for web3. Our research-led approach allows us to create adaptable templates that cater to the unique needs of diverse communities.\n\n**Library of Tools:** We curate a library of tools, comprised of modular, interoperable solutions that empower communities to fund projects and establish regenerative token economies. These tools, including the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting, facilitate the launch of CommonsDAO and complement the creation of a sustainable, polycentric governance model.\n\n\n# 🤝 OUR COMMITMENT TO OPEN SOURCE\n\nOpen source fosters a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual respect. It gives builders worldwide access to tools and resources that collectively drive research and social and technological advancements.\n\nWe champion a culture of radical openness as we believe transparency advances projects and productivity ethically and inclusively. We actively practice the philosophy of open source by building in public.\n\n\n# 📣 UPDATES SINCE GITCOIN BETA ROUND\n\n🚀 **Website Launch:** Our new website is live! We’ve spent the last couple of months reflecting on our culture, our mission and our work. Our new website highlights our mission and presents our work more clearly. Have a look: [https://www.commonsstack.org/](https://www.commonsstack.org/).  \n\n![Commons Stack’s new website](https://imgur.com/pxwBYVm.png) \n\n🧰 **CommonsDAO Toolkit:** We’ve been in pursuit of more funding to expand the reach of our CommonsDAO tooling, including the ABC and Conviction voting. We’ve been recently selected for Optimism Cycle 13 Builder Grant to extend our innovative CommonsDAO tooling, along with the Aragon DAO formation and management tooling, to the Optimism chain. The result will allow any community on Optimism to easily launch their own ABC! \n\n🗣️ **Event Talks:** We’ve been actively sharing our knowledge and insights at ETHBarcelona and EthCC. Our team delivered key presentations addressing crucial topics like token engineering, the power of myths, and the concept of a market for public goods. Watch the [full playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy6j39s17_jQRNO4vli-3WGZ8RaivFqLM) of our talks.\n\n![Livia Deschermayer at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/W2wiPwr.png) \n\n\n![Tamara Helenius at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/eM7ta2g.png) \n\n\n![Griff Green at ETHCC 2023](https://imgur.com/4M0bO2k.png) \n\n\n# 💰 PLANS FOR GG18 ROUND FUNDING\n\nFunding from this round will support our ongoing initiative - porting the Aragon client and  CommonsDAO tooling to Optimism chain. We received a 40K OP token grant from Optimism for this piece of work but (1) it does not actually cover the full scope of work and (2) the tokens will be locked for one year. Donations now will help us bridge that gap. This project is important because it lays the technical foundation for the TEC, should the community decide, to migrate to the Optimism chain. Additionally, it will allow projects and communities on Optimism to deploy their own Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC). \n\nThe success of this project will extend our CommonsDAO tooling to the Optimism community. This means **more projects gaining access to our innovative tools and ability to launch an ABC** to fund and govern their missions, empowering them to create sustainable token economies and effective governance models. We are working with our partners, Blossom Labs and General Magic, to realize this work.\n\nIn addition to supporting our specific projects, the funding from GG18 will provide a much-needed boost to our overall operations, particularly in navigating the challenges of the bear market. 🐻  We believe in the resilience and potential of the Commons Stack community, and with your support, we can continue to innovate and drive impact, regardless of market conditions.\n\n\n# 👥 OUR TEAM\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive work environment and prioritizing diversity and inclusion. Our team is 80% female team! And we span diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds, including **women from the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina and US/France**. \n\n[Tamara Helenius](https://twitter.com/tamarandom) - Tamara is a co-founder of Commons Stack,  and a former steward and current advisor for the Token Engineering Commons (TEC).

          "title": "DeSpace QF: Public Goods Funding in Space",
          "description": "# Project Title: DeSpace Quadratic Fund\n\n## Abstract \n\nTo align the Decentralized Space Exploration Ecosystem for public goods funding, we propose the DeSpace Quadratic Funding Grants Round. This initiative aims to raise and distribute funds to support the DeSpace ecosystem.\n\n## DeSpace Examples: \n- DAOs\n- NFT collections\n- Metaverses\n- Blockchain Nodes\n\n## Background: \nIn the previous community-driven [Decentralized Science Round on Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x6e8dc2e623204d61b0e59e668702654ae336c9f7), there was significant demand for Hardware & Decentralized Space Exploration projects. This round also laid the groundwork for the DeSpace QF because of intense preparations that built on top of the success of [DeSpace: Space Founder Circles](https://www.spacefoundercircles.com/) in collaboration with ReFiDAO. With the current momentum in the Web3 market, the project aims to fund public goods related to Outer Space using Quadratic Funding.\n\n## Problem Statement: \nStartups and research projects often face challenges in securing initial funding and public awareness. For Public Goods projects, such as Open Space/Lunar, funding challenges can hinder long-term independence and the acceleration of innovative space technologies.\n\n## Solution: \nThe rising popularity of DeSpace presents an opportunity to establish a platform that unifies the broader DeSpace ecosystem with aligned values as outlined in the [DeSpace Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWnfN8l2VlQA-n5QxNH9oDdJ1soqe-_EaQmVfi_G_9g/). The DeSpace Quadratic Fund aims to achieve this.\n\n## What is Decentralized Space Exploration: \nDecentralized Space Exploration is a sub-niche within web3 merging space exploration with decentralized systems. Instead of being dominated by major national space agencies or billionaires, this approach allows multiple entities or individuals to participate in space missions. Leveraging blockchain and community-driven initiatives, it promotes open-source technology, collective decision-making, and crowdfunding. This democratizes space activities, fostering inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation in Space by distributing control and participation across a broader community.\n\n## Public Good Definition: \nA Public Good is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. In the context of the \"DeSpace Quadratic Fund\", it refers to projects that benefit the broader decentralized space exploration community.\n\n## Quadratic Funding Explanation: \nQuadratic Funding (QF) is a democratic funding method for public goods. It prioritizes the number of contributors over the amount contributed, ensuring projects with broad community support receive appropriate funding.\n\n## Benefits of Quadratic Funding for Space Public Goods: \nThe first framework is proposed in the [DeSpace QF Lightpaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygLWjt32Na3fCXvuruUyoNKaXqS3urfkr63FjnTPMo0/). Using QF for space-related public goods ensures projects with wide community backing receive amplified funding. This approach captures the public's desires and needs, making it ideal for supporting space-related public goods projects.\n\n## Benefits: \n- Attract relevant DeSpace project audiences.\n- Raise awareness across the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Position as a hub for the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Provide initial funding and promotion for researchers and projects.\n- Create a Proof of Concept for Public Goods funding in Space Science.\n\n## Risks: \n- Insufficient initial funding.\n- Funding the wrong projects.\n- Potential for fraud and Sybil attacks.\n- High Gas Fees.\n- Challenges in KPI measurements & user onboarding.\n\n## Learnings from the Last Decentralized Science Round: \nThe team will leverage tools like Gitcoin’s Passport and Sybill Analysis Toolkit, switch to Optimism for low Gas Fees, and involve the B2B team for engagement.\n\n## Why this team? \nWe aligned leading DeSpace innovators, scientists and entrepreneurs from Space DAOs like [MoonDAO](https://moondao.com/), [SpaceRoxDAO](https://spacerox.org/), [Alpha Persei](https://alphapersei.com/) and [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to sit on one table, start this initiative and grow our ecosystem for the benefit of all!\n\nWe already committed advisors and supporters from [Copernic Space](https://copernicspace.com/), [Lunargistics](https://lunargistics.com/), [Axiom Space](https://www.axiomspace.com/) and [Astrocool](https://astrocool.com/) offering special perks to grantees or donors besides the Space DAOs already involved and more to be announced soon.\n\nConfirmed grantees are companies mentioned before, as well as, [Orbuculum](https://dlteo.com/), [MoonSociety](https://www.moonsociety.org/), [Lunco](https://lunco.space/), Open Lunar Comms and many more to be confirmed soon.\n\n## Objectives and Key Results: \n**Objective #1:** Conduct DeSpace QF Round on Gitcoin Grants Stack\n**Key Results for Objective #1:** \n- Raise a minimum of $25k from sponsors.\n- Draft Eligibility Criteria.\n- Get at least 10 grantees on the platform.\n- Facilitate the round.\n- Plan and execute co-marketing.\n- Build a DeSpace Cornerstone Fund for future Rounds\n\n## Metrics to measure success: \nMatching Pool Fund size, number of grantees, number of donors, amount and number of donations, marketing engagement metrics, number of sponsors/advisors, cross-promotion activities by grantees.\n\n## Founding Stewards: \n@ManuelOlariu\nManuel Olariu is the founder of DeepVenture.io and with Copernic Space he is building a space asset marketplace leading Innovation and IP standards. He is responsible for MoonDAO B2B while he is supporting various Decentralized Science and Decentralized Space activities. He led the last community-driven #GitcoinBeta Decentralized Science Grants Round utilizing Gitcoin's Grants Stack where MoonDAO played a critical part as the main initial sponsor of the Round.\n\n@_Difint_\nRod Mamin is a systems engineer, with commercial experience building and sending robots to the Moon, Founder of LunCo.Space, Grantee on DeSci & Open Source Software Gitcoin’s GR15, Alpha Round, Beta Round and MoonDAOs Space Engineering Guild Initiator and Ex-Steward.\n\n@PaulBurg_\nPavel Anisimov is an environmental scientist, with experience in public goods and decentralized communities.

          "title": "TE Career Builder for Womxn in Web 3",
          "description": "**What’s our ambition?**\n\nWe are ultimately working towards building a token engineering career building platform serving womxn in web 3, such as:\n\nhttps://www.adaslist.co/\nhttps://www.stemwomen.org.au/\n\nThis platform will serve as a hub for womxn in web 3 looking to build careers in Token Engineering to access an online community, connect with other womxn in web 3 around the world, visualise their career roadmap and feel empowered in their journey to building careers as token engineers.\n\n**Where are we now?**\n\nWe are currently running a study group for womxn in web 3 - bringing together a multi-disciplinary group of female and non-binary budding token engineers. Here is a snapshot of the academic/professional backgrounds of our participants:\n\nData Science - Law - Economics - Development - Innovation Policy - Design - Public Policy - Geography - Software Development - Behavioural Science - Finance - Physics - Maths -Business Development - Accountancy - Cybersecurity\n\nAs part of building our Womxn in Web 3 network, we capture our knowledge, discussions, insights and learnings on a collaborative MIRO board (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJwvJDA=/) and arrange workshops with female and non binary speakers to inspire participants to pursue careers in token engineering. \n\nWe recently conducted a workshop on Empowering Underrepresented Learners in Token Engineering at the recent Token Engineering Barcamp in Paris: https://youtu.be/f6vrvDp5OcQ. \n\nWe represented 1 of 3 sessions delivered by female/non-binary individuals at the event, which had a total of 14 sessions. In this session, we shed light on the barriers faced by underrepresented learners and how we design our study group sessions to combat them:\n\n1. Lack of Role Models\n\n - Arranging specific female & nb speaker sessions.\n - Finding accountability partners within the group.\n\n2. Unequal Digital Literacy\n\n- Designing an accessible/inclusive MIRO structure.\n\n3. Imposter Syndrome\n\n- Including space holding & story sharing time in sessions. \n\n- Co-writing blogs with other participants.\n\n- Using practical case studies to cater for different learner types.\n\n4. Limited Networking Opportunities\n\n- Attending conferences as a group/community.\n\n- Facilitating internship opportunities.\n\n\n**How does the project support Public Goods?**\n\nBringing more female and non-binary voices into Token Engineering will support the development and design of public goods/systems which have a more holistic impact on society. \n\nThese key systems thinking principles highlight why the gender gap impacts the design of public systems:\n\n- **Holism:** The idea that systems are more than the sum of their parts, and should be studied as a whole. This means to understand a system and the actors it serves, the design of the system should be undertaken by the range of actors who will take part. \n\n- **Reflexivity:** The recognition that the observer or designer is part of the system and can influence its behaviour. To have a male-dominated design team will only perpetuate biases in objective setting and incentive design. \n\n- **Perspectives:** The understanding that different people have different perspectives and experiences of a system, and that these perspectives can shape its behavior and outcomes.\n\n**What are the funds for?**\n\nWe are in the research and development stage of platform building. We’d like to formally work on building the study group for cohort 2 and are fundraising for the following:\n\n- 3 days / 24 hours a week \n- 20 weeks (i.e. duration of the cohort Aug - Dec 2023) \n- Rate = 30 USD per hour \n\nTotal cost for 480 hours @ 30 USD p/hour = USD 14,400\n\nAt this stage of our project, we are focusing on these key milestones:\n\n*1. Womxn in Web 3 Skills Showcasing*: writing articles/conducting online speaker sessions.\n\n*2. Career blueprinting*: formalising and visualising more nuanced career blueprints for underrepresented individuals. \n\n*3. Data Collection*: collecting data on the barriers faced by underrepresented groups at different stages of building careers in token engineering.  \n\n*4. POC Development*: building a proof-of-concept for the platform\n\nWe measure success against the following outputs:\n\n*1. Womxn in Web 3 Skills Showcasing*\n- Medium blog with 20 followers. \n\n- 3 Online Events with average attendance of 20 (e.g. Twitter Spaces, Speaker Sessions)\n\n- 2 workshop or speaker sessions on TE delivered by study group participants at in-person conferences/events (e.g. hosted by likeminded projects such as CryptoFemme)\n\n*2. Career Blueprinting*\n- Visual roadmap of a TE career blueprint in infographic form.\n\n*3. Data Collection*\n- Short report on barriers faced by cohort 2 participants in completing TE Fundamentals.\n\n*4. POC Development*\n- Platform Objectives\n- Resources Needed\n- Timeline for development\n- Success criteria\n\nIf we don’t reach this fundraising goal, we will continue to run the study group and build our community. We will aim to focus on activities 2 and 3. \n\nSpecifically, we will aim to gather data on:\n\n- barriers faced with completing the course\n- career trajectories being explored by different womxn in web 3. \n- barriers faced with choosing or following different career trajectories. \n\n**Who is in our team?**\n\nWe are a diverse team from the UK, Germany and Nigeria. We connected over a passion for increasing representation in the space. We bring fresh perspectives from fields of Psychology, Learning and Ecosystem Design, Systems Innovation, Software Development, and Ethical AI. \n\nYou can check us out online:\n\n- Madhuri Rahman -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhuri-rahman - @MadhuriRahman\n\n- Blessing Emah - https://www.linkedin.com/in/blessingemah - @TheblessingEmah\n\n- Lena Hierzi - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lena-hierzi-8221151ab - @Gigahierz\n",

Users who access the library read books or watch video-books and take a short quiz from the book. They earn NFTs when they prove that knowledge is impacted by passing the quiz. The Library will house books and videos in every discipline and make knowledge available for everyone including our children unborn because books are stored permanently on the decentralized web. This project brings the traditional library to web3.\n\n\n\nThe following benefit awaits users of this project\n\n\n\n  1. Lots of Academic E-Books especially in Web3:\n\n  2. Lots of Video-Books:\n\n  3. No Political Censorship:\n\n  4. Learn and Earn: The very First decentralized Library where you LEARN and EARN.\n\n  5. Live Class Streaming:\n\n  6. No Loss of Books: Prevent the accidental or intentional loss of information from human consciousness. Books are stored permanently for humanity.",

          "description": "# How can a fungible token be designed to carry high symbolic value? \n\nWhen tokens are non-fungible this is an easy task. Many NFTs are designed to hold little or no monetary value, and high symbolic content. \n\nAs an example, [POAPs](https://poap.xyz/about-the-protocol) are minted to symbolize memories of specific moments and events in time and/or space.\n\nFungible tokens cannot escape holding monetary value, but can they be designed to allow a richer symbolic value as well? \n\n**Could we create a token still compatible with permissionless automated market makers, but also useful for holding non-monetary values?**\n\n# Can a token carry meaning?\n\nKernel in their essay brings attention to the [signature economies](https://sign.kernel.community/essay) embedded in blockchains:\n\n*“Signatures do not enclose, they bear individual witness to shared events. The messages you sign are at once totally unique—there is only one valid signer in the whole world—and yet they can be broadcast many times over, each time accumulating meaning.”*\n\nAnd then asks:\n\n*“Can we create a culture where value is propagated by ongoing response, rather than held captive in possessions?”*\n\n![signature economies](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/700686323950026752/1139497889886908436/signature_economies.png)\n\n# This token engineering research project aims to:\n\n- **explore the possibilities for designing a token able to carry and express symbolic value**\n- **develop open source smart contracts available for the community**\n- **deploy at least one example instance of a SymVal token as a demonstration of its potential**\n\n\n# The path so far:\n\nWe started with the question: **How to code symbolic values in smart contracts?**\n\nInspired by ancient \"technologies\", we are exploring the idea of borrowing concepts and practices from Buddhism, such as prayer wheels, mantras, holy temples / stupas, with the goal of deploying a digital version of them to the blockchain. \n\nTo pursue this idea further, we have started a series of conversations with Marlon Barrios Solano, with the goal of arriving at a token model. \n\nMarlon is a creative technologist and researcher with a background in software engineering, improvisational dance, and embodied awareness, and also a resident meditation teacher and guest movement instructor for Kernel.\n\nAs an early experiment we also asked: \n**Can a token display more than just a balance in a wallet?**\n\nTogether with Simon Wairiuko from the Regro Project we proposed an idea for a token on the NEAR blockchain, taking advantage of the fact their token standard includes an on-chain token icon image supported by the NEAR wallet.\n\nSimon is an artist, farmer and developer, and he created an interactive SVG that shows day/night cycles, a tree's respiration cycle, and localized seasons like Winter and Summer, based on the device’s location and time zone. \n\nThis early experiment dealt only with the token UI display and not yet with the underlying contracts and logic, but was already a step towards the main research question.\n\nThe SVG can be visualized at: https://teia.art/objkt/651699\n\n![Regro interactive SVG](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/921764666567450664/937351385555542026/IMG_5352.jpg)\n\n# Where we are:\n\nWe are currently in the token design phase. As we progress we will post updates on our website:\n\nhttps://symval.gitbook.io/\n\n\n# Team:\n\nLenara Verle - https://twitter.com/lenara\nMarlon Barrios Solano - https://twitter.com/MarlonBarriosS2\nSimon Wairiuko - https://twitter.com/simon_wairiuko\n",

          "description": "The issue of user coordination lies at the heart of blockchain protocol design and financial incentives are one of the means to achieve it. These incentives are threaded in the architecture of the protocol and should enable extensive decentralization among network operators. Several projects have tried to achieve decentralization by employing different models based on financial incentives, each model tailored to the objective function of the protocol. Proof of Work (PoW) and the various iterations of Proof of Stake (PoS) exemplify the incentive models used to align network participants and reach consensus.\n\nPresently, numerous Layer 2 (L2) smart contract platforms built on the Ethereum network compete for market share and aim at network decentralization. In an effort to achieve decentralization within the network and to attract users from the broader ecosystem, these L2 platforms have incentivized usage of their networks through the distribution of their native tokens via 'airdrops'.\n\nOur goal is to build an online dashboard, named Airdrop User Retention Analysis (AURA), that can be accessed for free and could potentially inform incentive design choices for protocols that would consider employing airdrops in the future. Key to the realization of the dashboard is the definition of a metric that evaluates user retention over time on a dollar cost basis. Through the establishment and generalization of this metric, we aspire to devise a framework that facilitates comparisons between the effectiveness of the incentivization strategies employed by different L2 Networks.",

            "answer": "AURA aims to solve the problem of user coordination that lies at the heart of protocol design. We know that financial incentives are one means to achieve it; thus, projects have tried to achieve that coordination by employing different models based on financial incentives, with each model tailored to the objective function of the protocol. Airdrops are one of the most utilized means to attract new users; however, they often fall short in retaining these users after the airdrop event occurs. This effectively undermines the effectiveness of airdrops, as value rapidly flows out of the protocol, resulting in a hidden cost for the protocol.\n\nOur goal is to develop a robust and relevant metric that can assess the average cost for user retention within L2 networks. To achieve this, we will gather data concerning network usage and juxtapose it with the distribution dynamics of each network's native token. Specifically, we aim to analyze how network usage and user behavior fluctuated across different phases of the airdrop distribution.\n\nThe main way for us to determine whether we have accomplished our goal of providing value as a public good will be through monitoring the activity on our website. Once we publish the final version of the dashboard, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our study based on the traffic it receives. We will also offer support to users who would like to delve deeper into the analysis of each protocol's airdrop event, with the hope of informing future airdrop design decisions."

            "answer": "AURA contributes to the token engineering discipline by aiming to demonstrate that \"airdrops are not created equal.\" This means that there can be more and less effective ways of designing airdrop events. Since airdrops are closely tied to the tokenomics of a protocol and its token design, we believe that our study will help shed light on the sustainable design of protocol airdrops and potentially inform future design decisions, resulting in improved effectiveness.\n\nWe will initially focus on L2 protocols, as many projects have launched airdrops in this space, and attempting to capture all of this data would distract us from our main objectives. Once we have covered the L2 protocol space, the next milestone in our roadmap will be to expand to the broader DeFi space.\n\nAURA is considered a public good because it is freely accessible and built openly. This means we will share the analysis behind the creation of the dashboard, allowing projects working on airdrops to find AURA as a valuable resource for consultation. We are committed to keeping the project free and open, which is why we have applied to GR18 to secure a budget that can support our engineering and research efforts in developing AURA."

          "title": "Towards an Industry Standard Python Library for Token Engineering",
          "description": "\n### **Towards an Industry Standard Python Library for Token Engineering Models** \n\n\n### TL;DR\nThis proposal is to fund the joint collaboration between Token Engineering Commons and partner organizations to develop the industry standard token engineering models library using python param. \n\nThis proposal is to fund 6 part time developers for 4 months at a flat rate of $40WXDAI/hour as phase 1 of a 1 year development map.\n \n### Proposal description\nThe idea is to create the industry standard python library for Token Engineering.\n\nSimilar to how [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the industry standard python library for Machine Learning. \n\nThe objective is to produce an interface like the following:\n\n```python\nfrom tec.amm import Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Water\nfrom tec.issuance import AugmentedBondingCurve\nfrom tec.stables import DAI, LAMMA, FRAX\nfrom tec.lending import Aave, Compound\nfrom tec.token import Erc20, Erc721, Erc1155, Erc4626\nfrom tec.voting import Dandelion, ConvictionVoting\nfrom tec.dao import Hatch, Gardens, Safe, Moloch, CulturalBuild\nfrom tec.rewards import Praise, Coordinape\n\ncommons_build_model = Gardens(\n                phase1=CulturalBuild(rewards=Praise(), voting=Dandelion()),\n                phase2=Hatch(\n                        issuance=AugmentedBondingCurve(reserve_ratio=0.65, starting_price=1, starting_supply=1e6),\n                        voting=ConvictionVoting(parameter='supagov'),\n                        liquidity=Water(Uniswap(supply=1e4), supply=1e4),\n                )\n            )\n\ncommons_build_model.view_dashboard()\n#... continue analysis\n```\n\nI propose the use of [python param](https://param.holoviz.org/) to structure the library as hierarchies of parameterized classes. Python param allows python code to offer guarentees to it's users, definining parameters as typed attributes with default values, bounds, and documentation among other qualities like typed dataframes.\n\nOne of the great features of param is that parameterized classes can be automatically visualized in jupyter notebooks or web applications using python panel. This allows custom TE dashboards to be very easily developed as compositions of TE models. To see how param can be used to automatically generate interactive dashboards, see the documentation on [panel param](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Param.html).\n\nYou can read about my opinion on param [here](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/is-param-not-the-most-powerful-python-library-in-existence/385). To get more acquanted with param, I would recommend reading a few pages of [the documentation](https://param.holoviz.org/index.html), particularly interesting is the section about param enabling the [programming of contracts](https://param.holoviz.org/user_guide/Simplifying_Codebases.html#programming-contracts).\n\n\n### Additional information to add\nSome examples of TE models that have already been implemented with Python Param Panel:\n\n* ![Commons Build Hatch Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/f1d583c967cbc4544ded3779b12b4418750ba182.png)\n* ![Augmented Bonding Curve Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/534692fe5a0bc2a2d0a6fc936333453efa35a1d8.png)\n* ![Conviction Voting Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/bb6f444ff97b3b56f667052b6d21dd60a1d61192.png)\n* ![Vyper by Example Models](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5571a0db080f8648a3fa9ebbb8f472136c4dcf22.png)\n* ![Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool Model](https://forum.tecommons.org/uploads/default/original/1X/75c68a11628586f9f003e2184364265ac0d630a1.png)\n\n\nThe work funded by this proposal would consolidate these models into a single convenient library making them all accessible and combinable from a simple python import. This will establish a single models repository that can attract developers and gain momentum as an open source project.\n\n\n### How does this proposal benefit the community and/or the field of Token Engineering? \n\n* A universal TE models library is exactly what Token Engineers are lacking in their ability to rapidly combine rigorous models in the designs of safe and sustainable token economies. \n* This work will be an attractor that pulls software engineering talent into token engineering. \n* This work will put TEC on the map as a funder and creator of essential token engineering tooling and standards. \n* Having a central repository for these disparate models will create a **schelling point** that will allow the convergence of Token Engineering resources, resulting in a rigorously developed and tested community software package that will continue to flourish over time.\n* This work is compatible and arguably essential to the TokenGaia narrative that is gaining momentum among prominent members of the TEC.\n* This work will allow a standardization and common language around token engineering models.\n* This work is highly complimentary to concurrent TEC initiatives such as the Bonding Curve research group, the TE stakeholder study analysis, and the token engineering academy.\n\n### Amount requested (Only for Conviction Voting)\n* $45KWXDAI for Phase 1\n* 4 months of funding for 6 part time developers\n\n### How will these funds be used? \n* Simple flat hourly rate, $40WXDAI/hour/contributor\n* Total hours available = $45000 / $40 = 1125 hours \n* Target 10 hours/week/contributor\n* 6 contributors * 10  = 60 hours/week total\n* 1125 hours / 60 = 18.75 weeks of runway\n* 18.75 / 4.33 = 4.33 months of runway\n\n* $10,000WXDAI sent as deposit to YGG for a credit of 250 hours as project lead upon passing of the proposal. This will guarantee consistent availability for the duration of the 4 month phase 1 roadmap.  Other members to be distributed monthly at end of month based on hours logged at a maximum of 43 hours per month. \n\n* It's important to note that the proposed budget is very lean. This proposal is open to ideas of expansion, larger funding, funding partners, development partners, and general creative expansions.\n\n### **What does success look like?** \nThis proposal is to fund phase 1 of a one year development roadmap. A successful phase 1 would result in the release of a successful software package that is available to the Token Engineering community for utilization.\n\nPhase 1 Deliverables\n* Stakeholder research to drive library specification\n* Library specification defined\n* Library infrastructure and devops initialized\n* Library MVP initialized\n* Library phase 1 features completed, tested, and documented\n* Project Website and Communication Channel initialized\n* Phase 2 funding strategy complete\n\n### How will you share progress? \n* The community can track the repository progress on Github to see commits, merged pull requests, and updated documentation\n* A project website will be established that contains library documentation\n* TEC Community call updates (Monthly frequency)\n* Twitter Spaces discussions (Semi-Monthly)\n\n### Project information (if applies) \n* No project website yet.\n* This forum post will serve as project website until further notice.\n\n### Team Information \n* [YGG](https://twitter.com/ygg_anderson) (LTF) - Lead developer\n* [BK](https://twitter.com/bgkakadiya) (LTF) - Developer\n* [MD](https://twitter.com/mikedemelo4) (LTF) - Developer in test\n* [Rex](https://twitter.com/tokengineer) (TEC) - Developer\n* Open (TEC) - Developer\n* Open (TEC) - Developer in test\n\n### Complementary information\n\nThe idea of[ producing a universal TE models library](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/universal-python-library-for-te-models/443) has been discussed among the TE community for a long time, but I believe the ecosystem is mature enough now to strike towards the right direction in successfully delivering what is needed by the field.\n\nThis proposal is complimentary to concurrently funded TEC projects such as the Bonding Curve research group, the TE stakeholder study, and the proposed TokenGaia direction of TEC and TEA.\n\nThe availability of such a powerful design and engineering tool for Token Engineers will allow the field to advance rapidly and is essential in the development of safe and sustainable token economies in alignment with the mission of the TEC.",

          "description": "ITU (Istanbul Technical University) Blockchain is the first university blockchain society in Turkey. We are organizing blockchain events and courses for everyone. We have many students who are ready to improve themselves in this technology.\n\n-Devconnect Istanbul 2023-\n\nDevconnect will be happening in Istanbul in November. notDEVCON is a conference organized by ITU Blockchain on Nov 14. It will take all day in Istanbul Technical University Macka Campus. Also, a hacker house will be organized by BAF & ITU Blockchain. We're inviting all hackers to apply our hacker house and participate in notDEVCON.\n\n-Double Finalist in Scaling Ethereum 2023-\n\nWe've been selected as finalist with two projects in Scaling Ethereum 2023 hackathon which is organized by ETH Global. Opclave and Polynote teams are our two hackathon teams out of five. We participated in the hackathon with 25 hackers in total. It was the first hackathon experience for 18 of them.\n\nOur Free Solidity Course is Supported by Ethereum Foundation !!!\n\nWe've been published a free Solidity Course (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLby2HXktGwN4Cof_6a8YwlMrboX8-hs73) on our Youtube channel. The total duration of the course is approximately 20+ hours. The voiceover of the course was made in Turkish. As we continue to expand our Solidity course, we would like to announce that this education is supported by the Ethereum Foundation from now on.\n\n--2022-2023 Academic Year Update--\n\nAs with every year, many new members joined us this year. We reserved our first semester in the academic calendar for trainings and meeting with our community. So far, we have held 6 face-to-face trainings, 3 workshops, and 3 meetings between members. In other words, we have done activities in 12 weeks of the 14-week period. We consider it appropriate to share a few images from our events below.\n\n--Devcon VI Bogota--\n\nWe participated in the long-awaited Devcon Bogota as ITU Blockchain. We even had the chance to open Impact Booth at Devcon. All visitors were told about the blockchain community in Turkey and ITU Blockchain. Also, one of our former chairmans, Ulas Erdogan, took part in one of the Devcon panels as a speaker. We also had the chance to talk with Vitalik about the Ethereum community in Istanbul and gift him a t-shirt.\n\n--ETH Berlin & DappCon & DuneCon--\n\nWe attended ETH Berlin with 12 people from our club. We also attended DappCon and DuneCon, which took place as part of the Berlin Blockchain Week, and followed the talks. Our hackathon team placed second in the Open Track category.\n\n--ETH Mexico--\n\nOne of our members participated in ETH Mexico. He and his team became one of 12 finalists. Success continues with ITU Blockchain.\n\n\n\n--ETH Barcelona--\n\nOur teammates took part in ETH Barcelona both as volunteers and as participants. Our volunteer friends have gained a lot of experience on how to organize an event on a global scale. They shared their experiences with us. With these experiences, we will make future events in Turkey better.\n\n--Cryptist Istanbul Meetup--\n\nWe organized and participated in Cryptist Istanbul, the first zero knowledge-focused community event in Turkey. We took part as a team in the event attended by very important speakers and we found various networking opportunities.\n\n--ETH Prague Hackathon--\n\nWe participated in the Ethereum Prague Hackathon with our project on sustainability. We had the chance to meet and communicate with expert developers in the ecosystem.\n\n--Avalanche Barcelona Summit | Hackathon--\n\nAs ITU Blockchain, we came back as the team that received the most rewards from Avalanche Barcelona Hackathon. We returned to Istanbul with 2 different rewards in total.\n\nLayerZero Best Usecase Reward\n\nCoinbase Best Team Reward\n\n--Avalanche Hacks Istanbul--\n\nWe've completed Hackathon at 2nd place. It was an event where we gained a lot of experience and knowledge.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/itublockchain\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/itublockchain\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/itublockchain\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@ITUBlockchain/",

Right after our decision, we are posting our rationales both on Twitter and Governance Forums.\n\nWith our Twitter content, we are keeping our community up to date with situations of the projects of which we are delegating and educating them about token based decentralized governance. Thus, the community has a free and accessible resource on the token-based governance system. Not only that but by providing rationals by creating threads, we aim to show up for the whole community taking part in governance and letting them have another perspective for the proposal in question which in that case, is very valuable for other and especially individual delegates to involve in their decision making process.\n\nBeyond that, we are organizing events and educations about Web3 topics. This topics includes tokeng engineering, and we motivate our members to learn about and work in this area. \n"

Our goal is to use education as a weapon to break a circle of poverty, creating opportunities for income, growth, and sustainable development.  In 2021, Helpers Social Development Foundation establish the Helpers Foundation School in Oji-River, area of Enugu State, Nigeria. The school offers free education for all to date.  \n\n\nThe Challenge\n\n20 million children in Nigeria are out of school due to poverty. Lack of quality education is the primary factor preventing poverty-stricken families from opportunities for growth. Without quality education, the vulnerable will be unable to achieve their potential and end up going into early marriage or facing child labour.  Helpers Foundation school has produced the first pupils who graduated from our school. \n\n\n\nThe Solution\n\nHelpers Foundation school is the solution to prevent children from dropping out of school in Oji-River and will be for thousands of other children in Nigeria. By providing a standard of education for children. Education gives freedom and independence. \n\nAlong with free education, we will be educating children about cryptocurrency. Our curriculum will include setting up wallets, making transactions, NFTs, and some basics about DeFi. We will also be educating them about the dangers and risks of scams and other bad actors.\n\n\nLong-term Impact\n\nQuality education will Helpers Foundation school pupils break a circle of poverty and help support their families. Free school programs give pupils in our school a better opportunity to achieve their potential.\n\n",

          "description": "[![EMPOWER-HERW.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvFZwkfZ/EMPOWER-HERW.png)](https://postimg.cc/f3zTsXgZ)\n\nProject Summary\n\nYour gift will empower women and girls in Nigeria to learn, lead and thrive in our digital world. In Nigeria, more opportunities and resources are needed to ensure that many women and girls gain the digital skills that connect them with greater opportunities, leaving them marginalized and disadvantaged. With your support, we will work to ensure that the women and girls in our programs can access technology and data and receive training to become digitally literate to be valuable members of society. We are Crypto Empowerment Initiative with the aim to empower girls and women through skills acquisition. We have another organization called Helpers Social Development Foundation\n\n\nThe problems\n\nThe gender digital divide is a global issue that negatively affects women and girls everywhere, especially those less privileged and marginalized. Digital exclusion impacts many areas of women's and girls' lives, limiting their access to information and education and equal opportunities to participate in our increasingly digital societies. The COVID-19 pandemic moved many aspects of our lives online, making women and girls' lack of connectivity even more alarming. \n\n\nThe Solution\n\nWith our local partners in Nigeria, we can provide women and girls with access to data and technology and the training they need to become digitally literate. We are building a new computer lab at a local community center where we will have 10 computers. Many women and girls we work with are unemployed and have little or no access to the Internet. Those that do often need to gain the skills to navigate it. Providing women and girls with digital access means that they will stay caught up in their education and will be able to gain the skills they need to develop successful careers.\nAlong with general computer skills we will be educating about cryptocurrency. Our curriculum will include setting up wallets, making transactions, NFTs, and some basics about DeFi. We will also be educating them about the dangers and risks of scams and other bad actors.\n\nThe Long-Term Impact\n\nBridging the digital gender divide is essential to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in our increasingly digital future. Digital literacy has resulted in higher earning potential and greater job opportunities. Women will also be able to access essential tools, how to create cryptocurrency wallets and receive funds. By giving women and girls access to digital resources and the skills to use them, they can gain the power to shape their own futures and influence change in their communities.\n",

This allows us to educate GreenPill members in researching and building regenerative crypto-economies.\n\nFurthermore, we're partnered with an organization in Nigeria. We'll be traveling there next year to connect with more web3 communities. Africa is prime for web3 mass adoption through education. Currently, half a billion African citizens lack foundational identity, 900 million are under 30, and Central Africa Republic recently made Bitcoin legal tender. Cryptocurrency advocacy is growing, and potential innovators need education to leverage token engineering for their economies.\n\n---\n\n# Proof of Work\n\n## I. Github Tutorials and Guides\n\n\n### A. [Crypto Conductors Web3 Guide](https://github.com/MekailTheMachine/Crypto-Conductors-Guide)\n\nEducates on crypto: computers, solidity, encryption, and DeFi. Incorporates interactive gameplay (capture the flag) to incentivize knowledge solidification in smart contracts.\n\n### B. [Introduction to Encryption in Cryptocurrency](https://github.com/MekailTheMachine/Encryptedkiss)\n\nTeaches the fundamentals of encryption: public keys, private keys, merkle trees, etc., with python code examples.\n\n### C. [ULMFiT Machine Learning Tutorial on Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/0xJade/air-tweets/blob/master/air-sent_analysis.ipynb)\n\nTeaches how to build a machine learning project. Written like a book, covering data cleaning, pre-training, fine-tuning, and classification.\n\n\n## II. Research and Education Presentations\n\n\n### A. [Princeton Plasma Lab - Bubble Oscillations](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArmuhiurceRWqAy1HM7fpyNih7vN?e=Hz9g9M)\n\nResearch and educate peers and professors about applications of electrically-induced bubble oscillations.\n\n### B. [Princeton Plasma Lab - Langmuir Probe](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArmuhiurceRWxl_26fb_8GoUmA98?e=kBT7kj)\n\nResearch and educate about measuring plasma parameters using a Langmuir probe.\n\n\n## III. GreenPill Chapter Kickoffs & Education\n\n\nWe've helped set up chapters in Austin, Denver, Seattle, & Nigeria for GreenPill through traveling to web3 conferences and hosting events for GreenPill education and public goods.\n\n\n## IV. Web3 Wednesdays/Demo Days\n\n\nWe host demo days on our server every other week, showcasing new technologies and educating people on how to interact with them.\n",

          "description": "# **What is Permet?**\n\nPermet is building the first transparent, open-source, community-owned toolkit for the fashion creator economy.\n\nWe want to return power + ownership to creators and producers - and eliminate negative human rights and environmental externalities from the fashion supply chain.\n\n# **How does Permet fit Gitcoin Grants criteria?**\n\n- Permet is building a regenerative garment production system that breaks the \"create to sell\" garment production cycle - which currently drives the garment industry and creates massive waste in the process.\n- We are developing models for traceable garment production — which make metadata on the resources and labor behind garment collections accessible and transparent.\n- We are also creating new incentive models and technological rails that allow for the creation of value outside of the actual physical production of clothes (and the resulting waste that comes from that process.\n- Currently working on an OSS regenerative merch production tool that leverages trustless, onchain data + smart contracts — an environment and ethical-labor friendly alternative to current destructive merch production systems.\n- Soft-launched a research publication open-sourcing the process behind building Permet’s OSS tooling + physical supply chain — focused on educating young creatives on the use cases of blockchain technology. Can be viewed at **[permet.co/research](http://permet.co/research)**.\n- Launched Visual Maintenance System e-zine advocating for and building community around sustainable fashion — has been adopted by prominent artists like figure31, shl0ms, and terra0.\n- Permet is also working on the first open-source community-based supply chain. We have created an MVP supply chain in Toronto, CA and are producing the first garment sample prototypes with this supply chain.\n\n# **What progress has been made since alpha round?**\n\n- Permet (fka HibiscusDAO) has been part of past Gitcoin Climate + DEI + OSS rounds.\n- Our goal is to onboard new demographics into the blockchain ecosystem by creating new use cases on the application layer — especially for people of color and other traditionally overlooked demographics (who are the next generation of creatives and the next billion ETH users).\n- Since the last grant round that Permet participated in (alpha round) — distributed just under $25K to supply chain / participants, proving out a prototype model for alternative incentives in garment production.\n- We’ve also built an MVP supply chain of micro-factories and at-home producers in Toronto and have started producing samples of our first garments produced with this open-source supply chain.\n- We also created a research publication to open-source the core ideas/philosophy behind the work we are doing — with the goal of creating a community of the next generation of garment producers — and a garden of complementary initiatives and products that work in tandem / synthesis to Permet.\n- In the continuing spirit Virgil Abloh’s “Free Game” — we are open sourcing the principles and ideas behind leveraging blockchain technology as a way to give the people in the garment production supply chain (who actually need it) access to the life-changing use cases blockchains and OSS can enable.\n- Launched Visual Maintenance System e-zine advocating for and building community around sustainable fashion — has been adopted by prominent artists like figure31, shl0ms, and terra0.\n- We firmly believe that once the youth “hustlers” (or “shooters” — as we call them) realize the potential use cases of blockchain — adoption is inevitable. This ongoing initiative be viewed at **[permet.co/research](http://permet.co/research)**.\n- Permet onboarded a new team member (who happens to be a black woman) — the team continues to be 100% POC + black-led.\n\n# **WHY?**\n\n## **Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation**\n\nThe apparel and luxury market is growing exponentially: reaching $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.\n\nBut the industry's success is rooted in exploitation. Its business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation**\n\nSlave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands.\n\nThese human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation**\n\nTalented young designers generate massive value for brands - often with little to no compensation.\n\nA successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.\n\n### **Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation**\n\nFashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit.\n\nWhen overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.\n\n# **We’re a black-led team and here’s what we’re working on:**\n\n## **Enabling Profit Redistribution + Transparent Supply Chain + Community Ownership = Human Rights Impact**\n\nPermet recently created the first ever on-chain profit redistribution contract for garment production - redistributing profits from FWB merch sales to supply chain participants.\n\nPermet is looking to build on this by onboarding sewers, pattern makers, printers & other workers from the garment industry who are \"stuck\" working for a factory with no access to profit redistribution - giving them ownership over the value they create.\n\nBuilding cryptographic profit sharing into our tooling enables the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel.\n\nCrypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders:\n\n- Community owned ateliers vs. factories and manufacturers.\n- Fork-able concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.\n- Designs registered as on-chain vectors - enabling proper credit and compensation.\n- Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community.\n- Locally accessible physical design and fashion resources.\n\n## **Building a Transparent Supply Chain**\n\nCreating open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.\n\n## **Creating “Proof of Ethical Production” + Oracles**\n\nEventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.\n\n## **Fighting Fast Fashion = Environmental Impact**\n\nAs a part of our stack - we are working on the first solution for holding fast-fashion polluters accountable.\n\nNow we want to enable supply chain provenance and environmental transparency in the garment production process: create and test the first functional model for an open-source apparel supply chain to show how the garments were produced and the corresponding environmental impacts.\n\n## **Supply Chain Accountability**\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nNow that we’ve experimented with profit redistribution - we want to run experiments to figure out how to capture garment production metadata on chain.\n\nAnd after that - putting these new data capture + manufacturing processes into practice by experimenting with a garment collection that incorporates provenance and accountability around environmental impacts of the collection.\n\nWe hope that our efforts will set precedent and can serve as a model for future apparel projects. The current landscape of crypto fashion is “merch” that encourages wasteful consumption, enablement of existing exploitative power structures, and no regard for the environmental impacts.\n\nPermet seeks to change that by providing an alternative approach that enables sustainability which already reduces waste or gives accountability around environmental impacts of garment production.\n\n## **Open-Sourcing a Model for Ethical Clothing Production**\n\nThis experiment will inform the development of environmental oracles that will allow any apparel project to open-source their environmental impact and adopt new environmental standards - all done via leveraging supply chain metadata arising through the garment production process.\n\nThis supply chain experiment will be done with local supply chain participants in Toronto, Canada - with the hope of subsequently expanding out into other countries.\n\nPermet is creating and open sourcing the first model for a decentralized, transparent supply chain in fashion.\n\n## **How = Utilizing L2s for Real-World Crypto Use Cases**\n\nBlockchain technology is often criticized by naysayers as not having real-world uses.\n\nPermet’s goal of creating an open-source, community-owned supply chain is one of the strongest examples of an IRL use case for crypto.\n\nIn order to create a truly sustainable, community-owned supply chain for clothing, Permet needs to focus heavily on grassroots community work - onboarding sewers, pattern makers, textile producers, and other supply chain participants.\n\nIn many cases - these supply chain participants are members of underrepresented groups: people of color without much exposure to technology - who would be vulnerable to exploitation by traditional fashion industry structures and institutions.\n\nThese participants in the garment supply chain have never heard of blockchain before.\n\nOnboarding them onto Ethereum mainnet - and having them pay anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in gas fees - is simply not feasible for this demographic.\n\nInstead we will work directly with these local supply chain participants to onboard them into crypto via L2s - which can provide an accessible, feasible entry point to these new ecosystem participants.\n\nWe hope to use L2 infrastructure as foundational substrates to build real world utility and onboard new non-crypto native users.\n\nWe will open-source this process to create onboarding resources and serve as a model to other projects who are building real world use cases on L2s - to help accelerate driving real-world adoption.\n\n## **What’s next on the roadmap?**\n\nWe’ve hit our short term goal to use liquid 0xSplits to experiment with redistribution contracts for primary sales for garment workers since the last Gitcoin grants round.\n\nWe seek to build on this success by creating garments made using a transparent supply chain by open sourcing garment production metadata - proving out our model for supply chain accountability.\n\nThrough this process - we will onboard underrepresented communities onto Ethereum L2.\n\nAs mentioned above - we’re working towards a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically, without negative human rights and environmental externalities.\n\nWith an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.\n\nFor a deeper dive into our ecosystem, we invite you to read the first edition of our whitepaper linked on our website: **[permet.co](http://permet.co/)**",

Once the flywheel is spinning, the model can be replicated/adapted/extended to seed local regenerative communities. Our app code is open source, as are token scripts, obv, and more than a decade of knowhow consistently published into the public domain (wikipedia, ethresear.ch, twitter, medium, list goes on and on)."

          "description": "WHAT IS CADCAD?\ncadCAD is an open-source Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems through simulation. It is maintained primarily by volunteer efforts by contributors and its creator, Block.Science, an engineering, R&D, and analytics firm specializing in complex systems and operations research. \n\nThe incredibly important modeling and simulation tool is being applied in economic, social and environmental impact R&D, as well as ensuring the safety of new digital public infrastructures including crypto economic systems. (see below article list)\n\nABOUT THIS GRANT\nThanks to your contributions, the cadCAD ecosystem is evolving and expanding — both cadCAD’s core tech and the open source community around it are leveling up! 🤖 However, to bring on a few more much needed roles and continue to grow our model library, we need your continuing support 🙏\n\nWork is steadily progressing on the cadCAD 1.0 reference implementation, that includes a new programming methodology and better organization of code that makes it easier to use and more efficient for systems designers and analyzers.\n\nOn the community side, cadCAD is undergoing registration as a non-profit and preparing bounty programs to seed growth in model testing and development, education and operations. \n\nYour contribution will fund Gitcoin bounties targeted at helping onboard & educate people in the use of cadCAD, to grow the use of this key tool in crypto economic design.\n\nWHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR\ncadCAD's core development has predominantly been funded by BlockScience, and thanks to funding and support from the Token Engineering Commons and Academy, our community has also provided valuable contributions to the ecosystem, helping us improve documentation and educational and supporting materials. We want to take this to the next level by developing a bounty program to accelerate the creation of resources that can help onboard people from different backgrounds to cadCAD, such as:\n\n-Implement a read the docs-like style documentation website\n-Expand the Robot and Marbles tutorial series to cover the full extent of cadCAD's core feature set\n-Build reference system models that explore the full potential of cadCAD\n-Build open source models of general purpose crypto-primitives\n-Explore diagramming options that can help visualize a cadCAD model or plan its implementation\n\n\nHOW YOUR DONATIONS WILL SUPPORT CADCAD\nDonations will go to the cadCAD multisig managed by the volunteer team. The funding will be used to hire primary support roles including a project manager and community management position to design and initialize a bounty program. The BlockScience team and existing cadCAD user community will provide support for new community members engaging through the bounty program, and documentation and direction for this next phase of growth.\n\nCheck out the following articles to discover some of the high impact projects where cadCAD is being applied: \n\nhttps://medium.com/@e4rohan/a-conversion-guide-for-machinations-and-cadcad-ca94ccdea174\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/simulating-the-heights-of-olympus-analyzing-price-stability-in-the-mythic-defi-ecosystem-3237fb1a3996?source=collection_home---4------7----------------------- \n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/testing-armms-in-production-48a08afafdcc\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/complex-systems-modeling-of-community-inclusion-currencies-4e2161787934\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/alpha-bonds-risk-adjusted-bonding-curves-for-financing-impact-5be949fbc5a0?source=collection_home---4------4-----------------------\n\nIf you want to learn more about how and why cadCAD was created, take a look at these posts:\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/introducing-complex-adaptive-dynamics-computer-aided-design-cadcad-38b63b541eb8\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/cadcad-filling-a-critical-gap-in-open-source-data-science-fcd0d3faa8ed\n\nhttps://medium.com/block-science/announcing-cadcad-1-0-foundations-for-a-new-era-of-open-modeling-ea636b64fda7\n\n\nWe appreciate your donations and support and welcome you to join our community:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cadcad_org/status/1508536504079077386\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/GWPa28k\n\nForum: http://community.cadcad.org/\n\nGithub: https://github.com/cadCAD-org\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/cadcad_org\n\n\n🤖💗\n\n~cadCAD Team & Volunteer Contributors\n\nChris Catoya\nEmanuel Lima\nJoshua Jodesty\nMichael Zargham\nJeff Emmett \nJessica Zartler\n\n",

          "description": "⚔️ The Challenge:\nSustained bear markets have been a huge challenge for token valuations, with many DAOs and organizations seeing massive selloffs and price drops in the 90%+ range. When token price is a primary driver of the capacity to carry out work in a DAO ecosystem, volatile token prices are a hindrance to production in Web3 organizations.\n\n 🚦The Opportunity:\nUsing bonding curves as a continuous token issuance mechanism, organizations or communities can leverage algorithmic reserve and liquidity management strategies to provide volatility-damped token price fluctuations. The Token Engineering Commons Augmented Bonding Curve is a prime example of this, outperforming ETH through the bear market. This should be studied and exemplified in order to broaden education on these tools, and establish connections with organizations who need help designing and deploying them, which could also serve as revenue streams for further work and research.\n\n💪 Seizing the Opportunity:\nThis research group will provide research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms. This research body and content deliverables will attract new talent and interest in the field of Token Engineering, and it will additionally allow for a common understanding and language around bonding curves and their applications to DAOs, businesses, finance, and economics in general. This research could offer improvements for understanding the design and ongoing operation of these new economic mechanisms, benefiting the field of Token Engineering directly through upgraded tools like dashboards and simulators, but also indirectly through networking and deal flow.\n\nBonding curves are an emergent, Web3 native, economic primitive that redefine markets and liquidity. By determining price as proportional to supply, liquidity can be built into an economy, ending the era of market crunches, and enabling transparent and discoverable market prices for assets. The research, development and education in token economic primitives like bonding curves and cutting-edge research in the TE field has profound potential and implications for our economic systems.\n\n⤴️ Overview of Bonding Curves:\nBonding curves are an interesting new tool in the Web3 space, which can provide various automated dealer functions that tie two or more elements of a system together through mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. Also called automated market makers (AMMs), there are different types of bonding curves, including but not limited to constant product, constant function, concentrated liquidity, variable product, time-weighted, and even order book-based bonding curves. Bonding curves have also been ‘augmented’ with the addition of common pool treasuries or even prediction markets, in order to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new tools for social and ecosystemic benefit. \n\nThis is just the beginning of their utility, and current tools have only taken the first steps to explore this design space. Bonding Curves are a gateway for engineered control systems to facilitate and improve the economic management and value accrual systems of Web3.\n\nOur mission is to drive forward the research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms.\n\n🎯 The Purpose of this Research Group:\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a foundation for continuous research, development, and education around bonding curves. Our aim is to establish a deeper understanding of bonding curves in general, and a more thorough analysis of their applications thus far, including the TEC Augmented Bonding Curve. We plan to create a content funnel about bonding curves that educates the wider public and motivates projects seeking bonding curve expertise to connect with our community. This, in turn, will fuel the growth and development of the bonding curve space while providing economic opportunities to those involved with developing bonding curves for projects.\n\n⚙️ Continuous Development and Research Methodology:\nIt is worth noting that research initiatives are fundamentally different from development processes, which is one reason we are proposing this as a research ‘marathon’ work, as opposed to more task-based ‘sprints’ commonly held on faster time cycles among development teams. Research is fundamentally an exploratory exercise, often without clear outcomes at the outset of the initiative. For that reason, we will set deliverables such as content production timelines and hours input into processes as they’ve been laid out, rather than trying to determine ahead of time the exact topics or outcomes produced by the end of this first research marathon.\n\n📚 Past Work & Achievements : \nThe BCRG was founded in March 2023  and has three operational workstreams including Education & Content, Research & Ideation and Bonding Curve Analysis & Modeling. Here is a list of some of the work produced:\n\n1. Exploring Bonding Curves: Differentiating Primary and Secondary Automated Market Makers - https://mirror.xyz/0x8fF6Fe58b468B1F18d2C54e2B0870b4e847C730d/1Pxl_fbIPifIQ4_y0xoJGZGEk70qfOM3Gi9nWycm-8k\n2. Knowledge Library - a collection of resources discussing bonding curves and the mechanism design space for crypto economic system - https://www.notion.so/Knowledge-Library-ea2a517d82b142778e033a45bc115a80\n3. Case Studies (WIP) - case studies done on projects that have employed Primary Automatic Market Makers - https://www.notion.so/PAMM-Case-Studies-e994a43ab4dc4661aa355f868a20071e\n4. Bonding Curve Classification Notebook (WIP) - a quick look at different kinds of curves and their equations - https://www.notion.so/Bonding-Curve-Classification-0e85d52249594c6aaaf7e3dcdcd958b1\n5. Augmented Bonding Curve Model Github Repo (WIP) - an opensource python model used to simulate the Augmented Bonding Curve from the TEC ecosystem\n6. Bonding Curves Parameters Model - https://github.com/bonding-curves/conding/blob/main/conding/pamm/abc.py\n7. Token Engineering Commons Dune Dashboard & Python Translation - https://dune.com/rxx_/bondingcurves\n\n💸 Past Funding : \nWe applied and received catalytic funding from the Token Engineering Commons and Gitcoin, however we need further funding to continue in Phase 2 of our research and development so are currently applying for grants. \n\n🎖️ What Success Looks Like:\n1. Social media content posts, digestible and thought provoking\n2. Posts have community traction, bringing in new leads and interest into the TEC\n3. Improved methodology for analyzing Bonding Curves on-chain data\n4. Explore new bonding curve mechanisms and shed light to the creators of the provisions to include in their bonding curve : Shutdown & Liquidation Procedures, Develop gamified UX visualizations of the Bonding Curve where members can play with the parameter to see the final impact. \n5. Other unanticipated positive externalities discovered through research\n6. We would like to use our research to ultimately develop a Product & Services Business Model around Bonding Curves and are also going to experiment with launching our own investable workstream and bonding curve with Inverter Network. \n\n🔊 How We Will Share Progress:\n1. Transparent shared work processes (call notes, Miro board, call recordings as available)\n2. TEC forum announcements every third week, with links to posts & other work\n3. Scheduled interest group in the TEC Discord at the completion of the research marathon\n4. Deliverable outputs (videos, tweets, articles, etc) will be shared with the TEC community and beyond\n\nThank you for supporting Token Engineering public goods and the Bonding Curve Research Group! 🙏",

Also called automated market makers (AMMs), there are different types of bonding curves, including but not limited to constant product, constant function, concentrated liquidity, variable product, time-weighted, and even order book-based bonding curves. Bonding curves have also been ‘augmented’ with the addition of common pool treasuries or even prediction markets, in order to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new tools for social and ecosystemic benefit.\n\nOur mission is to drive forward the research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\nSocial media content posts, digestible and thought provoking\n\nPosts have community traction, bringing in new leads and interest into the TEC\n\nImproved methodology for analyzing Bonding Curves on-chain data\n\nExplore new bonding curve mechanisms and shed light to the creators of the provisions to include in their bonding curve : Shutdown & Liquidation Procedures, Develop gamified UX visualizations of the Bonding Curve where members can play with the parameter to see the final impact.\n\nOther unanticipated positive externalities discovered through research\n\nWe would like to use our research to ultimately develop a Product & Services Business Model around Bonding Curves and are also going to experiment with launching our own investable workstream and bonding curve with Inverter Network."

          "description": "Community-bound Tokens (CBTs) are modified ERC-20 tokens that can only be transferred among members of a community, which can be used for reputation, community merit based governance, opt-in social credit score, coordination games or engagement scores.\n\nCommunity-bound Tokens (CBTs) are tight to a specific community of members (or a group of addresses), as defined by mathematics (cryptographically) through for example memberships of a multi-signature wallet, an ERC-721 or a membership Soulbound token.\n\nThe philosophy behind it is, that although Soulbound NFTs can be used as badges, it's hard to quantify them for reputation, and mostly require more work, since they need to be done one by one.\n\nCBTs allow communities to decide how much they value certain actions and how many reputation points they attach to them. Preferably these actions are onchain so the CBTs can be dropped automatically to the earners, but they can also be off-chain by allowing the community to give CBTs retroactively based on a performed activity in the real world. Later on, these tokens can be used as a merit-based governance, for reputation, as a community credit score for under-collaterlised loans, or any creative ways the community can think of.\n\nFor this specific example project, with which we were finalists at ETHGlobal Paris, we forked a Safe{Wallet} and added a social layer to it. The purpose was to showcase how you can attach a specific value of CBTs to specific actions inside a Safe, and make a multi-sig more engaging to interact with by adding a Feed/Chat and reputation points to the proposed actions. When a proposal is passed, the proposer receives the reputation points (RP) that are attached to these specific types of proposals. They can range from proposing a new member, to proposing swaps, buying an ENS, or putting the community treasury to generate yield.\n\nSince the creation of the Community-bound tokens a couple of weeks ago, another team built another use-case around it for the Superhack, and we received a lot of interest from web3 communities who want to implement this to measure the engagement of their members, and gamify their communities\n\nHow it's Made:\nWe modified two parameters of the standard ERC-20 token to make it transferable to only a whitelist of addresses that comes, for example, from a Safe.\n\nThe deployed ERC-20 can only be ownable by community members, which in this case can only be added by the Safe multi-sig owner (the Safe itself). The functions mint() and transfer() can only be executed by the members of that community.\n\nWe forked Safe{Wallet} and integrated Push Chat into it. We then used Hardhat to deploy our custom made ERC-20 Community Bound Token to Sepolia, Linea, Gnosis Chain, Mantle, Zetachain and Celo.\n\n",
