          "description": "# Project Title: DeSpace Quadratic Fund\n\n## Abstract \n\nTo align the Decentralized Space Exploration Ecosystem for public goods funding, we propose the DeSpace Quadratic Funding Grants Round. This initiative aims to raise and distribute funds to support the DeSpace ecosystem.\n\n## DeSpace Examples: \n- DAOs\n- NFT collections\n- Metaverses\n- Blockchain Nodes\n\n## Background: \nIn the previous community-driven [Decentralized Science Round on Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x6e8dc2e623204d61b0e59e668702654ae336c9f7), there was significant demand for Hardware & Decentralized Space Exploration projects. This round also laid the groundwork for the DeSpace QF because of intense preparations that built on top of the success of [DeSpace: Space Founder Circles](https://www.spacefoundercircles.com/) in collaboration with ReFiDAO. With the current momentum in the Web3 market, the project aims to fund public goods related to Outer Space using Quadratic Funding.\n\n## Problem Statement: \nStartups and research projects often face challenges in securing initial funding and public awareness. For Public Goods projects, such as Open Space/Lunar, funding challenges can hinder long-term independence and the acceleration of innovative space technologies.\n\n## Solution: \nThe rising popularity of DeSpace presents an opportunity to establish a platform that unifies the broader DeSpace ecosystem with aligned values as outlined in the [DeSpace Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YWnfN8l2VlQA-n5QxNH9oDdJ1soqe-_EaQmVfi_G_9g/). The DeSpace Quadratic Fund aims to achieve this.\n\n## What is Decentralized Space Exploration: \nDecentralized Space Exploration is a sub-niche within web3 merging space exploration with decentralized systems. Instead of being dominated by major national space agencies or billionaires, this approach allows multiple entities or individuals to participate in space missions. Leveraging blockchain and community-driven initiatives, it promotes open-source technology, collective decision-making, and crowdfunding. This democratizes space activities, fostering inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation in Space by distributing control and participation across a broader community.\n\n## Public Good Definition: \nA Public Good is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. In the context of the \"DeSpace Quadratic Fund\", it refers to projects that benefit the broader decentralized space exploration community.\n\n## Quadratic Funding Explanation: \nQuadratic Funding (QF) is a democratic funding method for public goods. It prioritizes the number of contributors over the amount contributed, ensuring projects with broad community support receive appropriate funding.\n\n## Benefits of Quadratic Funding for Space Public Goods: \nThe first framework is proposed in the [DeSpace QF Lightpaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygLWjt32Na3fCXvuruUyoNKaXqS3urfkr63FjnTPMo0/). Using QF for space-related public goods ensures projects with wide community backing receive amplified funding. This approach captures the public's desires and needs, making it ideal for supporting space-related public goods projects.\n\n## Benefits: \n- Attract relevant DeSpace project audiences.\n- Raise awareness across the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Position as a hub for the DeSpace ecosystem.\n- Provide initial funding and promotion for researchers and projects.\n- Create a Proof of Concept for Public Goods funding in Space Science.\n\n## Risks: \n- Insufficient initial funding.\n- Funding the wrong projects.\n- Potential for fraud and Sybil attacks.\n- High Gas Fees.\n- Challenges in KPI measurements & user onboarding.\n\n## Learnings from the Last Decentralized Science Round: \nThe team will leverage tools like Gitcoin’s Passport and Sybill Analysis Toolkit, switch to Optimism for low Gas Fees, and involve the B2B team for engagement.\n\n## Why this team? \nWe aligned leading DeSpace innovators, scientists and entrepreneurs from Space DAOs like [MoonDAO](https://moondao.com/), [SpaceRoxDAO](https://spacerox.org/), [Alpha Persei](https://alphapersei.com/) and [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to sit on one table, start this initiative and grow our ecosystem for the benefit of all!\n\nWe already committed advisors and supporters from [Copernic Space](https://copernicspace.com/), [Lunargistics](https://lunargistics.com/), [Axiom Space](https://www.axiomspace.com/) and [Astrocool](https://astrocool.com/) offering special perks to grantees or donors besides the Space DAOs already involved and more to be announced soon.\n\nConfirmed grantees are companies mentioned before, as well as, [Orbuculum](https://dlteo.com/), [MoonSociety](https://www.moonsociety.org/), [Lunco](https://lunco.space/), Open Lunar Comms and many more to be confirmed soon.\n\n## Objectives and Key Results: \n**Objective #1:** Conduct DeSpace QF Round on Gitcoin Grants Stack\n**Key Results for Objective #1:** \n- Raise a minimum of $25k from sponsors.\n- Draft Eligibility Criteria.\n- Get at least 10 grantees on the platform.\n- Facilitate the round.\n- Plan and execute co-marketing.\n- Build a DeSpace Cornerstone Fund for future Rounds\n\n## Metrics to measure success: \nMatching Pool Fund size, number of grantees, number of donors, amount and number of donations, marketing engagement metrics, number of sponsors/advisors, cross-promotion activities by grantees.\n\n## Founding Stewards: \n@ManuelOlariu\nManuel Olariu is the founder of DeepVenture.io and with Copernic Space he is building a space asset marketplace leading Innovation and IP standards. He is responsible for MoonDAO B2B while he is supporting various Decentralized Science and Decentralized Space activities. He led the last community-driven #GitcoinBeta Decentralized Science Grants Round utilizing Gitcoin's Grants Stack where MoonDAO played a critical part as the main initial sponsor of the Round.\n\n@_Difint_\nRod Mamin is a systems engineer, with commercial experience building and sending robots to the Moon, Founder of LunCo.Space, Grantee on DeSci & Open Source Software Gitcoin’s GR15, Alpha Round, Beta Round and MoonDAOs Space Engineering Guild Initiator and Ex-Steward.\n\n@PaulBurg_\nPavel Anisimov is an environmental scientist, with experience in public goods and decentralized communities.

          "description": "# We are the movement towards a more sustainable and equitable future in #Medellín.\n\nThe goal of the node is to nurture community conversations around Web3 enabled regenerative-oriented-innovations (ROIs) and empower the youth in Medellín to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\n## Brief explanation of this project:\nWith this project we will develop the ReFi understanding and with it we will improve the environmental and social impact that new ventures can have in the Region, creating a new focus for ReFi projects and understanding, helping us to grow economically without destroying our environment and our lives in the process. We also work hand in hand with ReFiDAO helping to onboard more people into the ReFi environment.\n\n## Objective for this funding: \nWe want to carry out onboarding activities so that more people learn about the ReFi movement and focus their projects on this path and philosophy.\n\nWith greater awareness of the existence of this type of projects and technologies, we are sure that they will add very well to the city's trend of new technology-based ventures, progressively creating a boom in ReFi companies in the region with global impact.\n\nOur aim is to empower the youth in Medellín to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\n## Budget\nWe intend to raise 28.200 USD that will be well spent to generate the following ambitious outcomes:\n\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #1: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #2: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #3: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #4: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #5: 700 USD\n- Impact Onboarding Activity #6: 700 USD\n\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #1: 1.000 USD\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #2: 1.000 USD\n- ReFi Medellín Local Event #3: 1.000 USD\n\n- Medellín Eternal Spring Activity #1: 1.500 USD\n- Medellín Eternal Spring Activity #2: 1.500 USD\n\n- Medellín Blockchain Community ReFi Workshop #1: 1.500 USD\n- Medellín Blockchain Community ReFi Workshop #2: 1.500 USD\n\n- ReFi Hackathon #1: 2.500 USD\n- ReFi Hackathon #2: 2.500 USD\n\n- Incubate and Invest One Social Entrepreneurship that come out from ReFi Medellín Hackathon #1: 5.000 USD\n- Incubate and Invest One Social Entrepreneurship that come out from ReFi Medellín Hackathon #2: 5.000 USD\n\nWe believe that through ReFi Medellín, we can create a more socially inclusive and ecologically regenerative urbanism. Your support will enable us to make a significant impact on the lives of young people in our community, and we appreciate your donation.",

Join us in the adventure of reconnecting all the people  regenerating our country, with our capital city San José at the center of a collaborative movement to transform Costa Rica into a ReFi Lab for the World.\n\nFor our second Gitcoin Round we need your support to consolidate [Verano ReFi Costa Rica 2023: Regenerating our Optimism](https://www.cambiatus.com/es/verano-refi)  an inspiring collection of ReFi events to share what is possible and what is already happening in ReFi in Costa Rica..\n\nFor our second Gitcoin Campaign we have a goal to raise $20k to make the full vision of Verano ReFi Costa Rica a reality!\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai1KygCkTiE)\n\n\n## Project Overview:\n\nThe ReFi Costa Rica Local Node project is dedicated to advancing regenerative finance and decentralized technology adoption in Costa Rica. With a special focus on areas beyond the capital city, San José, the project aims to foster a thriving ecosystem that promotes sustainable development, economic empowerment, and community engagement.\n\n![photo ReFiCosta Rica](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2ad4fd8-761f-42c5-9489-c5441891cb2f_1024x683.jpeg \"group shot refi costa rica\")\n\n\n## Project Goals and Impact:\n\n+ _Local Engagement and Sustainable Development:_ The project seeks to introduce regenerative finance principles to regions such as Monteverde, Paraíso and Osa. By organizing events and workshops, it aims to showcase how decentralized technologies can drive sustainable economic growth while preserving the local environment and culture.\n+ _Regional Empowerment:_ Through events in Monteverde, Paraíso and Osa, the project aims to empower local communities with innovative financial solutions. These solutions can align with regenerative practices, leading to the creation of sustainable livelihoods, businesses, and initiatives that benefit the region's unique characteristics.\n+ _Community Collaboration:_ Collaborating with local partners, the project aims to facilitate collaboration among community members, organizations, and universities. By fostering a sense of shared purpose, it encourages the exchange of ideas, resources, and knowledge, leading to the creation of impactful regenerative projects.\n+ _Inclusive Governance:_ In collaboration with [Cambiatus](https://www.cambiatus.com/), the project is committed to co-designing a governance framework that reflects the principles of regenerative finance. This framework aims to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and community-driven decision-making, enhancing the long-term sustainability of the local node.\n+ _National and Global Integration:_ The project's vinculation with bigger events and organizations such as the II Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica during [Blockchain Jungle](https://blockchainjungle.com/) event and the Blockchain Week Costa Rica 2023 leadered by [AsoBlockchain](https://asoblockchain.org/) showcases the country's dedication to regenerative finance practices. Additionally, the involvement in the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon underscores Costa Rica's commitment to sharing insights on impactful governance and decision-making.\n+ _Educational Advancement:_ Through collaborative master classes with [ULACIT](https://www.ulacit.ac.cr/) and [VIU](https://www.universidadviu.com/) universities, the project strives to educate students about the intersection of regenerative finance and decentralized technologies. By nurturing a skilled workforce, it aims to empower young minds to contribute to the sustainable development of Costa Rica's economy.\n\n\n \n## Budget Breakdown:\n\nTotal Budget: $20,000\n\n_**15% Event Planning and Execution:**_ Funding will be allocated to organize events in Monteverde, Osa and Paraíso, covering venue rentals, promotional materials, and logistical expenses. \n\n_**25% San José Event Collaborations:**_ Contributions towards monthly crypto meetups in partnership with AsoBlockchain, and organization of the II Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica during Blockchain Week Costa Rica 2023. \n\n_**10% Educational Workshops:**_ Costs associated with conducting master classes in collaboration with universities to educate the local community about blockchain technology. \n\n_**25% Governance Co-Design:**_ Allocation for collaborative efforts with Cambiatus to co-design an effective governance structure for the local node. \n\n_**25% ReFi DAO Event Participation:**_ Funding to attend the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon, representing Costa Rica and contributing insights to the global ReFi community. \n\n\n\n## Expected Outcomes:\n+ Increased awareness and adoption of blockchain technology in Monteverde, Osa and Paraíso.\n+ Stronger blockchain community engagement through San José events and collaborations with AsoBlockchain.\n+ Enhanced knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology through educational master classes.\n+ Well-defined and inclusive governance framework for the ReFi Costa Rica Local Node in collaboration with Cambiatus.\n+ Meaningful contributions to the ReFi DAO event in Lisbon, elevating Costa Rica's presence and impact in the global ReFi community.\n\n>**We invite you to be a part of this transformative journey by contributing to our campaign**. Your contribution will directly impact the growth and success of the ReFi Costa Rica Local Node and its endeavors. Together, we can drive regeneration, education, and innovation in Costa Rica's blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n## Results from Gitcoin Beta\nFor our Gitcoin Beta campaign we aimed to raise $50k to support “Verano ReFi” a series of events inside and outside San José and start working on our own website and learning path.  Considering the amount we raised with the mazing support from the Gitcoin Community and the ReFi DAO and Metacrisis matching funds (~ $5k) we decided to focus on one big event and a series of meetups to keep building our community, as well as creating content for social media and growing our following. \n\n## Events\nWe were able to organize and support the following events in San José, Costa Rica: \n\n1 One day event, our I Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica.  +40 people attending, 8 projects presenting, 3 keynotes\n7 Cripto Cantinas ReFi. Reach:  +140 people\n3 events as guests: +95 people\n\n\n**I Encuentro ReFi Costa Rica (40 people attending)** \nOn June 24th, 2023, the 1st ReFi Costa Rica 2023 Gathering took place in Barrio Escalante, San José. The event saw the participation of over 30 individuals and organizations who are driving regenerative finance initiatives from all corners of our country. The event was graced by the presence of Anna Kaic, representing ReFi DAO from Mexico, and was co-organized by Cambiatus, Gaia Impact, Sendero, and Diamante Bridge Collective – all founding organizations of ReFi Costa Rica.

This is why we believe in the importance of launching a local node and promote regenerative agriculture practices here.\n\nThe needs to improve the ongoing initiatives are many, but the most important ones are uncorrelated communities solving humanitarian, climate and food security issues, which are all very entangled and deserve a neutral place to connect, open dialogues and implements regenerative practices on the ground together.\n\nI see an opportunity to bridge the ReFi community with the international organizations making efforts on these issues but lacking grounded and capable people to execute on solving locally proven experiments that need the backing to scale internationally.",

Any additional funds will be used to expand our reach and impact through marketing and outreach efforts.\n\nHere are some of our upcoming projects:\n- Food for Tomorrow: [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1km7fDG2BITpqyEXfCysY5uI1mVawK018416EOUU97n8/edit?usp=sharing)\n- \"Dobru\" & \"Growth Guides\": [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y3O3YJwJBrpJDYSPLdk8duU8MC6bddzSIgTopmOe8w/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur success will be measured by the number of individuals and organizations that are able to access resources and support through our network, as well as the impact of the projects and initiatives that we support.\n\n![Innoveren voor het Klimaat, Innovators Buzz](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/6382/y9lz4J.jpg)\n\nOur team consists of:\n\n**Timothy Goudzand**\n*Co-Founder at Infinitri*\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/goudzandt), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timgoudzand/)\n\n\n**Sedale Wijngaarde MSc.**\n*Co-Founder @ Infinitri | Community Manager @ Tradetomato*\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/DaelyBasis), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daelij/)\n\n\n\n**Isabelle Caldeira MBA.**\n*Operations Manager at Banking Network Suriname N.V.*\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelle_cal), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelle-caldeira-suriname/)\n\n\nReFi Paramaribo has the potential to transform Suriname's economy and catalyze positive social and environmental outcomes.

          "description": "As a part of an evolving network of coordiNATIONs, ReFi Lisboa is cultivating a regenerative startup society in one of Europe’s top web3 cities here in Lisbon, Portugal. Based on the core belief that we need to heal the world within in order to heal the world around us, we are bringing together regenerative technology, art, music, design, and economics to create a new culture in the capital of this beautiful country here in Portugal.\n\nIn November, we’ll host the inaugural gathering of regenerative startup societies—bringing key local and international leaders together to explore how we can fulfill a single unifying mission:\n\n*Regenerate the earth using the most powerful tools of our time.*\n\n![annual-meeting-portugal-narrow.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/521w124n/annual-meeting-portugal-narrow.jpg)\n\n## ReFi Annual Meeting — Gathering of Regen CoordiNATIONs\n\nAfter hosting 10 events and reaching over 700 leaders across public, private, and third-sector institutions, we’re taking our next step forward by hosting the ReFi Annual Meeting and inviting local and global leaders of regenerative coordiNATIONS to gather for the first ‘Davos of ReFi’ on Nov 6-7 in a prestigious city center location on the day after ETHLisbon.\n\n[REQUEST AN INVITE](https://tally.so/r/nGKZPe) 💌\n\n---\n\n## Gitcoin GG18 ambitions\n\nWe are aiming to raise $7500 in GG18 to continue to onboard talent and capital into the regenerative economy via web3 rails. This funding will be spread across three key initiatives:\n\n- **Monthly events (x3):** $3000\n- **Community & growth:** $4200\n- **Onboarding stations:** $300\n\n**Total:** $7500\n\n---\n\n![refi-lisboa-july-group.jpeg](https://i.postimg.cc/yNp9FhFb/refi-lisboa-july-group.jpg)\n\n### Recap from Gitcoin Beta\n\nThanks to the $3680 we received from Gitcoin Beta along with support from [Celo](celo.org), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/), we’ve been able to host 5 events, reaching over 328 leaders across web3, finance and impact. In partnership with [African Data Tech](https://www.africandata.tech/) and [Positive Blockchain](https://positiveblockchain.io/) we seeded [an initial directory app](https://ling478.preview.softr.app/) of the key people and projects of the regenerative society in Lisbon through an integration with [Catalist.network](http://Catalist.network). We also hosted our first [Gitcoin Activation Station](https://www.notion.so/How-to-host-an-activation-station-71c1676071444f7e930deec0672b3812?pvs=21) and created an open source guide as apart of the ReFi DAO Local Node Toolkit!\n\n---\n\n## Our vision\n\nWe aim to balance the power of technology with conscious awareness by establishing a physical network of regenerative leaders and spaces across various sectors and problem areas. We are bringing together public, private, and third-sector institutions, as well as thought leaders in environmental, ecological, social, and cultural domains.\n\nWe see ourselves as an accelerator for the regenerative economy embedded within existing institutions to help them harness the power of regeneration and work towards a prosperous future for all.\n\n![workshop-refi-night](https://i.postimg.cc/9X6d8Bv3/workshop-refi-night.jpg)\n\n## Meet the team\n\n- Emilie Viallon - People Lead & Events\n- John Ellison — Source Steward\n- Laura Malta — Events & Community Lead\n- Susanne Zapelão — Marketing\n- Rica Amaral — Partnerships & Events\n- Emiliano Gutiérrez - Product\n\n## Advisors\n\n- Carolina Carvalho — Ecosystem Mapping\n- Eduardo Marques — Strategy & Partnerships\n- Tariq El Haj Omar — Regenerative Project Development\n- River Roberts — Regenerative Real Estate\n\n## Technology is key\n\nWe believe that technology encompasses not only hardware and software, but also the incredible low-tech solutions that have existed for millennia, such as meditation, yoga, breath work, plants, and various forms of medicine.\n\nJoin us. 🙏🏼\n\n## 2023 OKRs 🗓\n\nFor the next 6 months, we want to achieve the following:\n\n1. Identify 2-3 land-based regenerative projects as a pilot for project development 🏜\n2. Release a hard-copy of ‘Lisboa Regenerativa’ and distribute it to 10,000 Lisboetas and tourists via local shops, cafes, restaurants, and tour providers 📔\n3. Announce a formal partnership with NOVA University, the University of Lisbon, and the City of Lisbon Municipality—hosting our first event together 🏫\n4. Host three volunteer days serving homeless, orphans, and refugees as a community.  🥗👨‍👩‍👧‍👧\n5. Spread the story of regeneration. ♥️☀️🤗\n\n![plsd_prw-87.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XY89v6X3/sheep-dj.jpg)\n🐑 We love sheep... who doesn't?\n\n## Finances\n\nAs of today, all funds are managed by a [multi-sig on Ethereum](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x728b09639453F3047E36D063C64C91b3871aFD92) and an [Open Collective account](https://opencollective.com/refi-lisboa) thanks to support from [all4climate](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao)!\n\n## Every DAI counts!\nWhether you're based in Lisbon permanently or just plan on swinging through, we'd be incredibly grateful to receive your support in GG18!\n\nSee you on the other side Regen! 🤙",

The immediate plans involve expanding the network, nurturing and incubating grassroots projects, and actively seeking funding for local regenerative initiatives. By fostering an ecosystem of collaboration, the project aims to ensure the long-term viability of sustainable ventures.\n\nWhat we have done so far:\n\nWe launched the local node during the Prague Blockchain Week, where we hosted an opening ceremony for the local regenerators and entrepreneurs.\n\nWe are writing a blog and running a podcast about the regenerative movement, which includes the \"I SEE\" model - a conceptual framework that integrates the principles of individual happiness and authenticity, social connections, economic/energy systems, and ecological alignment towards a regenerative future.\n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/daliborcerny.eth\n\nWe foster collaboration between many local individuals and entities, recognizing the importance of tighter connections between the public and private sectors.\n\nOur ultimate goal is creation and innovation in line with the principles of nature, which includes biomimicry approaches and designs, building of supportive networks, sharing, and striving for personal happiness of everyone involved.",

          "description": "TL;DR:\nWe are seeking funding through this Gitcoin grant to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania. Our project focuses on creating a waste regeneration system that integrates blockchain technology to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable finance practices with waste pickers at the heart of it all. We invite you to support our initiative to make a positive impact on both the environment and local communities.\n\nIntroduction:\nOur project aims to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania, with a focus on waste regeneration and blockchain integration. By combining innovative waste management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\n\nProblem Statement:\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of a waste regeneration system that transforms waste materials into valuable resources. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants.\n- Community Engagement: Raise awareness about waste-related issues and involve local communities in waste management and regeneration efforts as well as how they can benefit from sustainable practices in the form of carbon credits, tokenizing of Real world Assets and much more.\n\n\nWe are looking to revive the machinery at our incubated site to increase capacity and production of these eco-products such as eco-spare parts for Rickcshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which will help add additionality to our project to enable it to receive quality carbon credits which will eventually raise the basic income of our waste pickers from a mere 0.1$ per kilogram of plastic waste.\n\nExamples of our eco products include eco-spare parts for Rickshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which are massively needed to support local Tanzanians and their small businesses. \n\n\n\nThe Team:\n\nOur team consists of dedicated individuals with diverse expertise:\n- David Machuche from Chatafisha, Project Lead: A professional with deep knowledge of local ecological challenges, Regenerative Finance, financial inclusion and Web3 for real world use cases. \n- Victor Muhagachi from Chatafisha, Strategy and Web3 for local communities: An experienced strategy designer, blockchain developer specializing in onboarding local communities to Web3 in broken down Swahili terminologies.\n- Eng. Allen from Zaidi Recyclers Kimambo, Environmental Scientist: A waste management expert with over 10 years experience and a background in sustainable development.\n- Teresia Mhaiki Community Outreach Coordinator: A communication specialist focusing on community engagement, specifically in environment and sustainability.\n\nBudget:\n- Technology Development: $10,000 for decentralized app that will contain sub wallets for waste pickers, track credit scores with blockchain integration.\n- Infrastructure & Plant: $20,000 for setting up waste regeneration facilities and community engagement centers.\n- Logistics for waste: $2,000 for reallocating the waste from collection points to recyclers.\n- Awareness Campaign & Events: $2,000 for educational workshops, awareness programs, and community training.\n\nCall to Action:\nWe invite you to contribute to our mission of creating a more regenerative and sustainable future in Tanzania. By supporting our project, you will play a crucial role in addressing waste management challenges, promoting eco-friendly practices, and fostering transparent financial systems. Your donation will have a lasting positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the overall well-being of the region. Together, we can drive meaningful change and lead the way towards a more sustainable and prosperous Tanzania!\n\nOur address is 0x037Eb04AD9DDFf984F44Ce5941D14b8Ea3781459\n\nImage link for the process on how it will work: https://postimg.cc/KRwMn9Sx",

          "description": "# Our Vision: Raise awareness of stakeholders on ESG and carbon neutrality through Regenerative Finance and web3 technology.\n\nOur vision for ReFi Hong Kong is to create a transformative paradigm that merges environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles with cutting-edge web3 technology. By doing so, we aim to raise awareness among stakeholders about the importance of ESG factors and carbon neutrality, ultimately fostering a regenerative economy that prioritizes sustainability and positive impact.\n\nConsidering our main focus is raising awareness, we believe that by leveraging ReFi and web3 technology, we can effectively educate stakeholders about ESG principles and carbon neutrality, make ESG strategy easier and more attractive. Through innovative financial mechanisms and web3, we will empower and incentivize individuals, businesses, and organizations to understand and actively participate in sustainable practices. By highlighting the interconnectedness between financial decisions and the environment, society, and governance, we can foster a mindset shift towards regenerative approaches.\n\nThus, emphasizing on transformative potential of ReFi, by harnessing the power of web3 technology, we envision a financial ecosystem that promotes transparency, traceability, and accountability. Through these mechanisms, we aim to catalyze the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy in Hong Kong, where businesses and individuals actively contribute to the regeneration of natural resources and the enhancement of social well-being.\n\n# Our Mission:\n\nBased on the innovation of Web3 in technical and financial field, the ReFi DAO HONG KONG could help various stakeholders (government, WEB3 enthusiast, financial institutions and family offices and etc.) included but not limited:\n- To achieve their own carbon neutrality, and to implement innovative methods to practise the CONCEPT of NET ZERO.\n- To explore opportunities on ESG, green and sustainable finance field\n- To wake up public awareness of ESG\n- To accelerate the youth-led education in web3 and regenerative-oriented field.\n\n# Background: The Opportunity in Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong's government has recently taken a proactive stance in supporting the growth of the crypto and Web3 industries by creating a safe space for companies to operate. \n\nThe government has launched a new policy initiative called \"Hong Kong: Asia's World City for Crypto & Blockchain,\" which aims to promote the city as a leading hub for these technologies. This initiative will provide a regulatory framework that balances innovation and investor protection, fostering a stable and safe environment for companies to operate.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is also showing a strong commitment to ESG. In 2019, the government launched the Green Finance Certification Scheme, which encourages financial institutions to develop green finance products and services, and provides certification to those that meet certain criteria. The government has also set a target of reducing Hong Kong's carbon intensity by 65-70% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and has implemented various policies and initiatives to promote renewable energy and efficiency. In addition, Hong Kong has been a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment since 2016, and the government has recently launched a new initiative to promote sustainable finance in the city.\n\n# Challenges From ESG to ReFi\n\nReFi is the next evolution of ESG. Rather than simply reducing harm, ReFi aims to support regenerative practices that restore and improve ecosystems and communities. Additionally, finance instruments can empower regenerative solutions with efficiency and scalability. \n\nStill, lack of self-awareness among individuals and communities regarding the value of ReFi is the key challenges for the Hong Kong local node. The society is in the early stages of seeing a thriving regeneration and web3 ecosystem emerge, and local communities are skeptical about how effective ReFi could be in tackling climate challenge. We cooperate with several initiatives such as Carbonbase, Arkreen, BTC Club and interact proactively with local investment communities. These initiatives offer a solid foundation for the ReFi Hong Kong community to build upon and create a network of like-minded individuals and organizations committed to regenerative finance and sustainable investment. \n\nAlthough the prospects of ReFi in HongKong is bright and brilliant, the path is hard and tortuous. We are facing some realistic challenges. Convincing the highly discerning communities that are raised in an international and developed society is not an easy job, we need to keep constant visiting, impressing them with detailed cases and work, such as arranging high-quality roundtable meetings, exhibitions and other activities. All these brings financial callenges for us and we wholeheartedly appreciate the granting from government, academia and of course, the web3 community like you.\n\n# Action: 1st Online Twitter Space Talk:\n\n27th July 2023, ReFi Hong Kong organized the 1st online Twitter Space Talk. Hosting by ReFi Hong Kong contributor, we invited 4 speakers from different industry (Carbon World, RGRT, New Energy Nexus & Allinfra) to share their exploration and practice of ESG and ReFi in Hong Kong.\n\n![ ReFi Hong Kong organized the 1st online Twitter Space Talk]( https://cdn.discordapp.com/ephemeral-attachments/1092492867185950852/1140845568046932008/Online_Twitter_Space_Talk.png)\n\n# We intend to raise: 5,000 USD that will be well spent to generate the following ambitious outcomes by the end of 2023:\n\n# Your donations will help make this all possible! \n\n## 1. *Engage the local community: 2,000 USD*\n- Host Twitter Space Talks \n- Host at least 2 offline events in H2 2023.

          "title": "Empowering Regenerative Entrepreneurship in Altos Mirandinos",
          "description": "We aim to democratize regenerative entrepreneurship in Altos Mirandinos through education, networking, and technological empowerment. By leveraging blockchain technology and the ReFi framework, the project seeks to unite local producers, farmers, and entrepreneurs to create sustainable economic opportunities and promote positive social change.\n\n**Welcome to the Venezuela ReFi Node efforts, welcome to regeneration**\n\nLos Altos Mirandinos, a vibrant hub with diverse industries and unique challenges, stands next to the capital of Venezuela. Despite hyperinflation and complex market conditions, the city possesses immense entrepreneurial potential. This project's goal is to harness this potential by creating a regenerative ecosystem through education, networking, and blockchain-powered innovation.\n\n**The Role of Twist Studio Creativo:**\nTwist Studio Creativo, a pioneering community center, will spearhead this project. We believe that regenerative entrepreneurship is the way forward for Venezuela, focusing on sustainability, social impact, and equitable economic growth. Our extensive network of entrepreneurs and professionals will serve as a catalyst for meaningful change.\n\n**Refi Spring Grant and Bootcamp:**\nHaving received the Refi Spring Grant, we initiated the ReFi Bootcamp – a cornerstone event that educates local producers, entrepreneurs, and farmers about blockchain, sustainability, and regenerative business models. This bootcamp introduced participants to the transformative power of Web3 technology. These same people will be the first to benefit from this project and become multipliers of the ReFi movement. \n\nThe Problem and Solution:\nVenezuela’s diverse landscape houses both global corporations and sprawling slums. We aim to bridge this gap through education, networking, and technological integration. By using blockchain, we democratize access to data, fostering collaboration and equitable AI development. Our project focuses on regenerative entrepreneurship as an alternative path to economic growth, mitigating hyper-consumerism and revitalizing sustainable practices.\n\n**The Project's Goal:**\nOur primary objective is to unite local producers, farmers, and entrepreneurs with regenerative insights and experiences to create a certification of single-origin and coffee quality. Through education and mentorship, we aim to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to build sustainable businesses.\n\n**How will we do it?**\n\nWe count on a strong community that has already been onboarded on ReFi and is committed to the mission. Among these we have the brothers Barrios, third generation of coffee growing in the region, and Jannina Pójan leader of the International Women’s Coffee Alliance (IWCA), also known as @thecoffeeteacher. Using their leverage with a larger community of more than 150 producers we will multiply our previous work with the ReFi Bootcamp and continue to grow as a large ReFi community. \n\nOur first milestone will be to organize a series of different onboarding activities to make each of these members actively engage in Web3 and ReFi. \n\nAlso among our community leaders, we have Osiris Ostia @Biosirisnatural an activist agriculture engineer that works to bring a more sustainable approach to the region with Mr Apolinares, a descendant of natives who proudly brings real empirical experience on how to restore our ecosystems. They will be in charge of the field training to provide fundamental applicable tools to our producers. \n\nFinally, we will utilize collected data and standardized procedures to create our first NFTs and recognition to the community. Their final product (Coffee and products) will be accompanied by digital proof of their impact and sustainable methods. \n\nFor the development of on-chain reputation certificates with NFTs and the trust-building process with the Web3 and Sustainability communities, we count on our friends of TrustedSeed and our local organizations as Corporation B Venezuela. \n\n**The Team:**\n\n**Susana González:** An adept storyteller and networker, dedicated to Web3 sustainability at ImpactScope. With a background in fostering relationships in the entrepreneurship community, Susana brings an innovative perspective.\n\n\n**Daniel Alejandro Knobelsdorf:** Founder of Transience Labs and a key player in Ethereum Venezuela, SingularityU Caracas, and more. Daniel brings a wealth of experience in blockchain technology and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n**María Fernanda Cordova:** A community builder and Ed-tech advocate, María champions innovative education initiatives. Her expertise in leadership and social impact is a valuable asset.\n\n**Budget:**\n\n- Training (Bootcamps, mentoring sessions): $3,000\n- Field training: $2,000\n- Development of on-chain reputation certificate with NFTs  $1,000\n- Incentives as microcredit: $1,000\n\nWe invite you to be a part of this transformative journey by contributing to our grant. Your support will enable us to empower local entrepreneurs, create sustainable opportunities, and foster positive change in Venezuela. \n\n \"Those who are entrepreneurs in Venezuela are seeking to regenerate it.\" Hence, the ReFi business model naturally aligns with the country's current needs. Venezuela, a nation in need of regeneration, stands to gain numerous benefits from ReFi, as do other countries facing similar circumstances.\n\n\n**Donate Today to Empower Regenerative Entrepreneurship in Los Altos Mirandinos!**",

          "title": "ReFi London — Convening Leaders of Change.",
          "description": "### **Overview**\n\nAt the crossroads of entrepreneurship, finance, and world-leading institutions lies London— a city teeming with talent, capital, and a history of leading change. Against this backdrop, ReFi London is emerging with a clear purpose: to bring together the city's unparalleled strengths and channel them towards building a sustainable, regenerative future.\n\nWith your support, this grant will be the seed from which we build this community. We will offer events & meetups for leaders to converge, develop a comprehensive map of local regenerative projects, and support Regens Unite London. Together, we will make London a leading light in the global regenerative economy movement.\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe roots of ReFi London are embedded in the global ambition of ReFi DAO—a vision to cultivate a worldwide regenerative economy through a network of interconnected local communities known as ‘Local Nodes’. ReFi London aspires to be a beacon among these Nodes, rallying high-impact leaders and leveraging London's leadership in finance, entrepreneurship, technology, and academia for positive change.\n\n### **Key Activities Supported by this Grant:**\n\n**35% - Support for Regens Unite London:** Bolster the efforts of Regens Unite London by providing financial sponsorship and active participation to further our shared missions of uniting the regenerators of London. This will serve as the kickoff for ReFi London with a collaborative workshop to convene stakeholders in co-creating this new organisation.\n\n**25 % -** **ReFi London Knowledge Graph & Website:** Fuel the development of the ReFi London Knowledge Graph and the accompanying website. This platform will serve as a comprehensive map of London's regenerative economy ecosystem and local projects. It will empower members with the data, connections, and insights they need to catalyze meaningful change and serve as a key first step for going on to actively support local regenerative initiatives (e.g. community/city farms, local cooperatives, re-wilding initiatives etc..)\n\n**40% - ReFi London Summit & Events Fund**: Half of the grant will be channelled towards an Events Fund in preparation for the ReFi London Summit and other upcoming events. Recognizing London's unparalleled position as a hub of talent and innovation, these events aim to attract the best of the public, private, and third-sector leaders beyond the immediate bubble of Web3 & ReFi. With your support, we can ensure these events reach their full potential, making them the cornerstone of our community-building efforts, networking opportunities, and knowledge exchange with policymakers and think tanks.\n\nThrough the allocation of the grant's funds to these core activities, we are poised to set in motion a transformative wave of initiatives that fortify London's position as a pioneer in regenerative finance and sustainable practices. Every penny will be used judiciously, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed our objectives in making London a leading light in the global regenerative economy movement.\n\n### **Join Us!**\n\nReFi London is a call to leaders, innovators, and changemakers to step forward and coalesce their efforts towards a common goal: a regenerative future. In this era of unprecedented challenges, the solution lies in unity, collaboration, and a shared vision. Support ReFi London, be part of the revolution, and let's together sculpt the regenerative economy of tomorrow 🌱\n\n[![Social-Media-Header-3-A-Warm.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtYJ2CxR/Social-Media-Header-3-A-Warm.png)](https://postimg.cc/dkdCdqCB)",

          "description": "### Tulum’s Tomorrow: Accelerating the Regenaissance with ReFi Tulum\n\nReFi Tulum is an instrumental force driving positive change for Mexico and the world, embracing the two key pillars of **circular economies** and **regenerative tourism** to shape a sustainable, equitable future for generations to come. Our vision focuses on innovation, community engagement, women's empowerment, and impactful storytelling to ignite the \"Regenaissance.\"\n\n\n[![tulumbeach.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/0Qh8Xct0/tulumbeach.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/KkrSRrh1)\n## Why Circularity and Tourism?\n\nThe world is at a pivotal point, demanding a paradigm shift towards circular economies and regenerative practices. Tulum, with its pristine beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant culture, has captured the hearts of travelers, digital nomads, and expats from around the globe. However, its popularity has come at a cost; the growth of the population and influx of millions of visitors have put a strain on its fragile ecosystems, infrastructure, and cultural heritage.\n\nTulum's allure is deeply rooted in its natural beauty and rich heritage. By adopting circular economies and regenerative tourism, we're not only preserving these unique attributes but enhancing them. Our innovative initiatives bring together tourists, local communities, and businesses in a collective effort to restore and protect Tulum's environment. This approach goes beyond sustainability; it ensures Tulum thrives for generations to come.\n\n### Circular Economies through Innovation: Technology and Incentivization\n\nWith our core partner, [Petgas](https://www.petgas.com.mx/), we're leading the charge in the de-plastification of the planet, leveraging existing technology solutions to address a lack of waste disposal options especially prevalent in Mexico, as well as impacting humanity around the world. Our mission is clear: to embrace circular economies and regenerative tourism as pivotal strategies that will shape a sustainable and equitable future for generations to come.\n\n**Plastic pollution is a global crisis**, and ReFi Tulum is committed to addressing it head-on. Here's how we're tackling this critical issue through **Web3 incentivization, Education, and Innovation**:\n\n- **Web3 Incentivization**: We're harnessing the power of blockchain tech and Web3 to incentivize and reward individuals for their active participation and “mining” of plastic waste from the environment.\n  - Through a measurement and rewards system powered by a mobile app, we want to change the way people, both tourists and locals, see plastic, from a waste into a resource. They will see their wallets gain tokens with each plastic drop-off and successful plastic weigh-in.\n  - We plan to use NFTs to fund investments in plants, machinery, measurement, and logistics to start the circular flow of waste to sellable products and passive income streams for holders. NFTs can be used in a multitude of ways from plastic traceability and measurement to rewards for actions such as POAPs, and many types of membership structures that provide access to machinery and other benefits.\n\n[![jaguarplasticbeach.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/g22K4D17/jaguarplasticbeach.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8RswqvQ)\n\n-**Education** ReFi Tulum is deeply committed to fostering education and awareness as cornerstones of our mission. We intend to cultivate a learning ecosystem that spans various dimensions of sustainability, regenerative practices, and plastic waste management. Through workshops, training sessions, and engaging experiences, we will empower local communities, tourists, and children with knowledge about responsible plastic use, circular economies, and the significance of the Blue Circular Economy. \n\n- **Innovation - Thermoformation for New Products:** Through thermoformation technology, ReFi Tulum plans to transform plastic into a variety of usable resellable products, from furniture and building materials to plastic collection bins. This process not only addresses plastic waste but also supports our self-sustainability, as the repurposed plastic contributes to our operations and initiatives.\n[![tf100.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/50XvD9Jd/tf100.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/XG0pCbXQ)\n\n- **Measurement**\nIn our commitment to tackle plastic pollution, we have implemented a beginner system of measurement and traceability. For instance, each plastic jaguar collector, when filled, holds 12 kg of plastic waste. At the National Beach jaguar zone, the placement of 3 of these collectors results in the collection of 36 kg every 5 days. This cumulative effort, amounting to 180 kg per month, effectively neutralizes significant amounts of plastic waste. This measurement and traceability approach ensures the tangible impact of our initiatives in combating plastic pollution.\n\n[![tracking.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KjDSKFkG/tracking.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/kRGhZ0vz)\nThrough these innovative strategies and collaborations, we can lead the charge in deplastifying the planet. By leveraging technology and aligning incentive structures, we can turn the tide against plastic pollution, and showcase that success to inspire others around the world.\n\n## Regenerative Tourism Movement to Clean, Restore, and Transform\n\nThe **ReFi Tulum Regenerative Tourism** initiative aims to reimagine Tulum's tourism industry by shifting from a focus on sustainability to regenerative practices. By engaging tourists, businesses, and local communities, we aspire to create a thriving and resilient destination that preserves and enhances Tulum's natural and cultural heritage for generations to come. We believe Tulum and the surrounding area offer the right and necessary conditions to be a successful model to the world of how to regeneratively develop a tourism industry that not only mitigates its negative impacts but actively contributes to the restoration, preservation, and thriving of both the natural environment and local communities, setting a powerful example for global destinations seeking a more responsible and regenerative approach to tourism.\n\nTulum's Riviera, known for its exquisite natural splendor, ancestral heritage, and magnetic allure, serves as the canvas to illustrate tales of regeneration. These experiential narratives not only profoundly impact travelers but also leave enduring, regenerative imprints on the very places they explore. We want to shift tourism from exploitative to one of rejuvenation, all while targeting the critical global issue of plastic waste.\n[![milagros.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6QDLWNTs/milagros.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/67fGcgdz)\n## Our Vision: Immersive Regenerative Experiences\n\nOur goal is to develop immersive and educational experiences that provide visitors with an opportunity to actively participate in regenerative activities such as beach cleanups, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable agriculture. This will also provide an opportunity to showcase local Mexican projects to the world for greater visibility, growth, and project acceleration. Using regenerative tourism to create a collective effort to regenerate and protect Tulum's ecosystem.\n\n### Experiences\n\nEngage in IRL (in real life) utility of web3 planet positive collections such as the House of Panther, Restore Coral, CocoCoin.club, Entre Monedas, Maya Spirits, Crypto Papaya, and many others in regenerative land cultivation and other ReFi companies that are using web3 to accelerate positive change. We will develop experiences as well as a 7 or 8-day road trip that visits the best examples of ReFi in the area.\n\n### Collaborative Restoration\n\nWork with local groups and government agencies to develop scalable mangrove planting and jungle restoration operations and attract global organizations for large scale planting activities.\n[![siankaanmangrove.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/25MFkL28/siankaanmangrove.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/XZKyxJRT)\n\n**SolarPunk Electric Scooter Private Beach Experience** is the first a la carte regenerative tourism experience that can be purchased with crypto and takes visitors on an unforgettable journey along Tulum's Mayan Jaguar Road, with a stop at the breathtaking archeological ruins while engaging in regenerative practices and ending at a private beach for self regeneration and ocean healing.\n[![sandrascootersolarpunk.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Vkyx64L2/sandrascootersolarpunk.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/fJK2qcdv)\n\n## Community Engagement\n\n-**ReFi Web3 Women** gatherings take place once a month at the NFT Boutique. These gatherings cover and educate on topics such as What is ReFi, quadratic funding, and DAOs. The aim is to inform and empower women to join the ReFi movement and share their insights with their communities.\n[![2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zGf93z2X/2.png)](https://postimg.cc/Vd37V8c3)\n[![web3women.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/4dBK4m6F/web3women.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/gXLcNcBv)\n- Development of art and functional works with children made from plastic, as well as artworks turned into NFTs.\n- Collaborate with indigenous leaders and businesses to develop web3 educational programs that resonate with the community.\n- Creation of workshops and training sessions for children’s web3 education and parent onboarding in parallel to helping children.\n[![ashanti.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6pH7r72V/ashanti.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HrysHktj)\n\n## Use of Funds\nThe allocation of funds will play a pivotal role in advancing our mission. Specifically, a substantial portion of the funds raised will be directed towards the acquisition of the TF100 machine, a cutting-edge technology that holds the key to transforming plastic waste into valuable resources. This crucial step will mark the initiation of our blue circular economy, where repurposed plastic will be utilized in the creation of functional and sustainable products. By investing in the TF100 machine, we are laying the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem that not only combats plastic pollution but also generates revenue to fuel our regenerative initiatives.\n\nTo supplement these costs, we are embracing the innovative power of NFTs  Through strategic NFT offerings, we aim to not only raise additional funds but also engage our community in a unique and rewarding way. NFTs will serve as more than just digital assets; they will be a symbol of collective action, allowing supporters to have a tangible stake in our circular economy journey and allow holders to take part in sales from the new economy outputs. This fusion of cutting-edge technology and community engagement will drive the financial sustainability of our initiatives and amplify their impact. Your support will directly contribute to jumpstarting this transformative cycle of environmental restoration and economic empowerment, made possible through Gitcoin Grant quadratic funding.\n\nReFi Tulum stands as a potent catalyst for transformative change, not only in Mexico but across the globe. Rooted in the pillars of circular economies and regenerative tourism, our mission is a resounding call to action, forging a path towards a sustainable and equitable future for generations to come. A vision fueled by innovation, community empowerment, women's agency, and impactful storytelling ignites what we proudly term the \"Regenaissance.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "Our project aims to revolutionize climate education and sustainable farming practices within rural farm communities in Nigeria, by harnessing the power of Web3 technology. As these communities face increasing challenges posed by climate change, we recognize the pressing need to empower local farmers with knowledge, tools, and resources to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.\n\nThrough strategic collaboration and Web3 events, we will create a dynamic ecosystem that connects indigenous knowledge with cutting-edge climate science, fostering a resilient and informed farming community. Key components of our initiative and impacts include:\n\nLocalized Learning: Our platform will offer context-specific content, integrating indigenous knowledge and traditional practices with the latest advancements in climate science, tailored to the unique challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Nigeria.\n\nInteractive Workshops: Virtual workshops and simulations will provide farmers with hands-on experience in implementing sustainable farming techniques, encouraging experimentation and innovation.\n\nPeer Collaboration: Decentralized discussion forums will facilitate collaboration among farmers, enabling the sharing of experiences, best practices, and local insights.\n\nBlockchain-Backed Rewards: Farmers actively engaged in learning and implementing sustainable practices will be rewarded with blockchain-based tokens, incentivizing active participation and knowledge sharing.\n\nBy merging Web3 technology with climate education, our project envisions a future where rural farm communities in Lagos achieve climate resilience, food security, and economic prosperity. By empowering local farmers with knowledge and tools, we aspire to create a sustainable and vibrant agricultural sector that not only adapts to climate change but also leads the way in sustainable practices for the region.\n",

We try to build a label-rich user portrait system, which is based on on-chain and off-chain data analysis and data mining, infer user identity through algorithms models and offers the final user identify evaluation service.\n\n# Why we build Inferer?\n\n1. We're still in a early stage of crypto development, and user environment is under chaos in some way. There're so many bots around which hurts user experience, so    many security accidents occurred in these days which stopped more users from getting engaged with crypto. Hence, we hope we could build a service which identifies the users through the behaviors behind the address. We would need to use the benefits from the immutable data on chain and do lots of data analysis and data mining to achieve that goal. On the other hand, we would also like to offer great products which facilitate end users to have a much more convenient way to check the identity of the account address. In this way, we hope it could increase the cost of bot activities and raise the bar when they try to hurt others, which we hope would improve the user environment ultimately.\n\n2. The data infra system and user label system we built in the above process could also help serve in SocialFi projects and Risk Control in fund transfer on chain.\n\n# What's our vision?\n\nWe believe the value of data analysis and data mining would grow very quickly when data on chain explodes. And Inferer would like to start from users' perspective and build more great products to form a web3 user identity platform, which we hope could help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.\n\n# What we're currently building?\n\nWe're currently focused on building a user identity analysis product, which hope to facilitate crypto users to have a convenient user identity check and reduce the bot activities. This'll start from a nice tool for crypto users to improve their efficiency at the beginning. We hope we could help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain in the end.\n\n![](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/daa44d9a3796d1bd8da62885e95c407b/intro.png)\n\nWe believe COMMUNITY matters a lot in Inferer. And we're trying to build our community which Inferer belongs to. Anyone who's interested is greatly welcome.\n\n# Update\n\n2023/7/29:\n\n1: We're excited to announce that Inferer officially supports Inferer Ranking on website https://ranking.inferer.xyz. It offers great product quality with concise on-chain data analysis! Brand new product user experience, new design interface, more advanced data analysis, we're offering a high level product and we're pretty proud of it. Again, we're committed to keep improving Inferer Ranking and believe it would bring huge impact in crypto project analysis.\n\n2: We have another great product Inferer Identity is on the way to get online as well (expected late Aug early Sep). That's also amazing! If would introduce a great scoring system for crypto users and provide great values for projects to check their target users avatars. Please give us a little bit time to build it to a great quality and we have confidence that it would surprise you.\n\n3: Recently we're discussing a lot on future airdrop product and have a great finding on this. We're having a demo to verify the concept. We do believe it would be a thing to crypto community.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F2WVefob0AAHIFS?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n2023/4/7:\n\n1: For Inferer community gitcoin members, we're back! Back here to report our progress regularly, and brings with an amazing new product - Inferer Ranking.\n\n2: We're excited to announce that Inferer could not only support the on-chain user address identity analysis, but also for on-chain contract web3 projects (especially NFT project). This would be obviously a tremendous scope improvement for Inferer. We hope not only we could provide users efficient identity look up tool (compared with checking transactions in etherscan or polygonscan), but also we could provide a brand new & efficient way helping users checking projects(especially NFT) users' group portraits, which could be a great reference for new users to check whether a project is with good quality or just a scam project to rug pull. We believe some new crypto users would need this and we treat this in a very valuable way!\n\n3: We love Reddit! Not only their avatar nft users grow exponentially from 3m to 10m, but also for the unbelievably great crypto-friendly culture. We enjoy quite a lot in having discussions in Reddit. And it helped us to determine our first project analysis landing on Reddit Avatar Collections. It's quite valuable for us to analyze all avartar through, which gives us a very clear concept that which avartar series is now trending and which nft now leads in profits. We believe this would be quite useful for those reddit avatar traded users. In the long run, we're going to cover many more projects and willing to bring great values for crypto users. We believe this would definetly bring great values to crypto and help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/af7660b3640f3eda4fdbda801bc733e7/Frame_1321314535.png)\n\n2023/02/16:\n\n1: We're excited to announce officially that Inferer now has a brand new official site https://www.inferer.xyz. It brings totally new design language and much better user experience. This new version shows great product level in Inferer. We believe that you all would love it.\n\n\n2: We brought a great internal engineering product here: Inferer label backend system. In order to reach unbelievably lots of labels, we need to improve our label processing efficiency, in a massive improvement way. In detail, it needs to handle label creation, label deletion, label edit, label check, label daily update, label comparison, label degrees and many more label related operations, all in a user friendly way with great efficiency. This leads to our new coming amazing product: Inferer label backend system, which aimed to cover these requirements and take overall label processing efficiency to a much higher level. Inferer label system has come to v1.0 and been put into use NOW. It would also iterate very quickly. We're very passionate to polish this tool to help Inferer reach to next stage.\n\n\n3: We're excited to announce that AWS has decided to help fund in Inferer! We had amazing conversations and had a very great consensus: Inferer is a great project and would like to see the achievements that Inferer would take in the future. That would be a very interesting thing that we both believed.\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/e9eba657ae1339a539a38cc6040c0b15/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2023-01-31_%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%884.11.36.png)\n\n2022/11/28:\n\n\n1. We're excited to announce that Inferer Search has been renamed to Inferer Identity.\n\n\n2. Inferer Identity has updated to v0.0.13. In this version, we included a major new feature: Inferer Label, which would be the key to our future user identity analysis service. Inferer Label would serve directly into our user portrait system and become the data basis in our evaluation algorithms. We would increase lots of labels to help us reach the precise analysis result.\n\n\n3. For Inferer Label, not only we're adding more & more labels, we also try to dig more interesting dimensions on labels. We add 'degree' metric to Inferer Label, such as \"Big Ens User\", which refers to users who adopted more than 5 Ens names on their account or \"Ens Collector\", which refers to users who adopted more than 30 Ens names on their account, this extend info would help a lot in figuring out user's motive or interest. We're excited to see the benefit this brings to our evaluation process.\n\n\n4. On engineering, we want to reach the point that Inferer Internal System could label new qualified users day by day, automatically. And we have covered this NOW.\n\n\n![](https://d31ygswzsyecnt.cloudfront.net/docs/b5d062a0df2ffc2553710c2fd10c90f5/Frame_45.png)\n\n\n2022/10/22:\n\n-   Inferer Search has updated to v0.0.10. We put quite much time on many details which we believe would improve users' experience in a long time. Some of them listed:\n\n\n    1. always focus on the address edit text which could help users to replace new address, and avoid delete address one by one\n\n\n    2. fix that some users can't launch \"Inferer Search\" through mouse' right click \"Inferer 0x*****\" after they sleep the computer\n\n\n    3. add more twitter KOLs in Recommend feature, which facilitate users' check on these KOLs' identity\n\n\n    4. add more hackers info in Warning feature, which we hope could help keep users from scams\n\n\n    5. integrate internal server APIs to optimize the JSON API response time\n\n\n    6. add support for users to switch their binding address to inferer account\n\n\n2022/09/28:\n\n\nWe officially launched our Inferer Search product in chrome store now. Check it out https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inferer/cihpoafnmmlancocngfdmdcfhkfjglnj. DM us anything on Twitter(https://twitter.com/inferer_xyz). And join us if u're interested, let's build it better!\n\n![](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/c8ceb97d0bad680107fd0a023c2de702/c2.png)\n![](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/0ca867df396a801f5660318471408190/c3.png)",

          "description": "Proposal: ReFi Local Node - Pindamonhangaba\n\nOur ReFi Local Node project in Pindamonhangaba seeks to bridge the gap between sustainable practices, holistic well-being, and the emerging world of Web3 technologies. Through a series of engaging and diverse events, both in-person and online, we aim to reconnect individuals with nature, foster community collaboration, and provide educational content in Portuguese about Web3 and decentralized finance. Our initiative will include curated photography exhibitions, immersive agroforestry experiences, and online onboarding sessions. By combining art, nature, and technology, we strive to inspire regenerative action in our local community while supporting the global movement towards a more sustainable future.\n\n1.\tIntroduction to the Project: The ReFi Local Node project in Pindamonhangaba is dedicated to fostering a sense of interconnectedness between nature, sustainable living, and the Web3 movement. Our vision is to create an inclusive space where individuals can engage with both the physical environment and the virtual world, ultimately contributing to a more regenerative and harmonious future.\n\n2.\tProblem and Solution: Nurturing a connection with nature and harnessing the untapped potential of Web3 technologies for advancing sustainable practices remains a challenge in our community. Through a series of engaging events, we intend to bridge this gap. By combining hands-on experiences with digital platforms, we aim to create a holistic understanding of how technology and nature can coexist to address real-world challenges.\n\n3.\tProject Goals: Our primary goal is to reconnect people with nature and empower them with knowledge about sustainable practices and emerging technologies. We envision building a community that actively participates in reforestation initiatives, agroforestry workshops, and Web3 education. By fostering this synergy, we aspire to promote positive changes in individual behaviors, communal relationships, and environmental awareness.\n\n4.\tTeam Presentation: Our team consists of passionate individuals deeply committed to sustainable living and technology. Jorge, Deroila, and Cauê bring diverse expertise in sustainability, community engagement, and tech education. We are further supported by partnerships with NFTreesBrasil and Diogo from @agroforestDAO, enriching our efforts with their valuable insights and experiences.\n\n5.\tImpact Measurement: We believe in quantifying our impact through tangible metrics. Attendee participation, post-event surveys, and engagement rates on social media platforms will help us gauge the success of our initiatives. Additionally, we will collect narratives of changed behaviors and testimonies from participants, reflecting the positive influence our events have on their daily lives.\n\nWe're committed to transparently measuring our impact and sharing our progress. In addition to traditional methods, we're exploring innovative ways to showcase event outcomes, including the possibility of using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent tangible evidence of positive changes. These NFTs could capture transformed spaces, participant testimonials, and online collaborations, providing a more engaging way for the community to see the results of their involvement. This aligns with Web3 principles and enhances our mission of promoting sustainability and Web3 awareness. The NFT concept is in exploration, and your support will help us refine this approach, adding a unique layer of engagement and accountability.\nHow You Can Make a Difference:\nBy contributing to the ReFi Local Node - Pindamonhangaba, you are directly supporting:\n\n• Experiential Activities (Palestras, workshops, and field-based activities): Join us in hosting thought-provoking discussions, skill-building workshops, and hands-on field activities that bring sustainable practices to life.

          "description": "ReFi ja és aquí! 🌱\n\nReFi Barcelona is a ReFi local node, building bridges between the ReFi and the local ecosystems, propelling the development of the ReFi movement in Barcelona.\n\nWe want to design engaging ways to learn from diversity and build communities of collaboration based on a shared understanding of the vast opportunities that lie in the transition towards regenerative cultures. Creating regenerative systems is not simply a technical, economic, ecological or social shift: it has to go hand-in-hand with an underlying shift in the way we think about ourselves, **our relationships with each other and with life as a whole.**\n\nReFi Barcelona idea is to be aligned with Commons principles by promoting shared ownership, community engagement, and decentralized decision-making for sustainable resource management.\n\n## Barcelona 🌞\n\nBarcelona is the biggest (entirely) European city in the Mediterranean sea. The city, and Catalonia in general, has a rich history and actuality of support to progressive initiatives. \n\nBarcelona, as a densely populated urban center, faces a unique set of challenges stemming from its status as a bustling metropolis and the impacts of over-tourism. The city's social fabric has undergone transformations due to increased tourism, which has at times strained local resources and community cohesion. Furthermore, the depletion of natural resources, coupled with recurrent droughts exacerbated by rising temperatures due to climate change, has compounded these issues.\n\nThere is a growing web3 ecosystem in the area with deep roots in the history of web3.\n\n### Appetite for Regeneration 🧑‍🌾\n\nPublic institutions such as the Ajuntament de Barcelona (city council) has had a big focus on positive social & ecological change, with active initiatives addressing urban regeneration, waste management and climate change - being reference in many of these. Government and institutional support for sustainability projects is notable, creating a conducive environment for local initiatives. The city is known for its innovative character and is home to numerous entrepreneurial ventures and investment activities that can be aligned with regenerative principles.\n\n## ReFi Barcelona Gènesis 🌱\n\n![ReFi_BCN_Kickoff](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F1z0YbgWIAETCCQ?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\nOn the 20th of July ReFi Barcelona had its Kick-Off event bringing together an initial group of people interested in supporting the strengthening of regeneration and ReFi in Barcelona.\n\nCheck out some more about the event here: https://twitter.com/ReFiBarcelona/status/1683490586018422795\n\n\n**The local node can offer a range of goods and services, including:**\n\n- Regenerative events, workshops, and networking opportunities.\n- Sustainable project incubation and support.\n- Community engagement and citizens' assemblies for shared decision-making.\n- Partnerships with local businesses for collaborative initiatives.\n- Funding opportunities through grants, web3 native fundraising, and partnerships to projects.\n\n\n**ReFi Barcelona plans to secure funding and revenue through various channels, including:**\n\n- Grants from programs like Gitcoin and CLR.fund.\n- Community events, memberships, and sponsorships.\n- Ecosystem grants, such as for Celo's and Optimism's.\n- Collaboration with local initiatives and government support.\n- Exploration of other web3 fundraising mechanisms.\n- Capitalization and tokenization of positive action.\n\n## Team details 🌟\n\nReFi BCN founding team:\n\n- [Luiz Fernando Gomez Segala](https://twitter.com/louizfe)\n- [Justina Svitaite](https://twitter.com/jcukini)\n- [Emanuel Toledo](https://twitter.com/emanuel_tol)\n- [Roger Pan](https://twitter.com/rog3rpan)\n- [Emilia Sierra Guzmán](https://twitter.com/MowgliRegen)",

          "description": "ReFiDAO Saravena is a community located in Saravena, a city in Arauca, Colombia, where conflict and guerrilla activities have impacted the region, in addition to the presence of oil companies in the area.\n\nFrom the municipal government's side, there are few environmentally impactful proposals. General awareness campaigns have emerged aimed at the population, but with limited impact.\n\nWe've taken on the challenge of initiating our ReFi community with the idea of making an impact on our region.\n\nHere's what we aim to achieve:\n\n1) Identification of habitats or locations for tree planting.\n2) Trash collection drive.\n3) Engaging with foundations or tourism companies to guide tourists off the traditional tourist path, introducing an alternative tourism plan that allows exploration of different positive aspects of Saravena municipality, such as its rivers, farms (banana, cacao, orange, yucca, etc. cultivation).\n4) Establishing an environmental awareness program in schools, taking students to events focused on cleaning specific areas for tree planting, aiding in river conservation, and creating gardens within educational institutions.\n5) Promoting a shift in the environmental care culture of the Saravena population, starting with the promotion of biodegradable or reusable bags.\n6) Advocating for respect towards indigenous communities and contributing to the preservation of their cultures.",

Our aim is to empower young South Africans to support initiatives that address Cape Town’s most pressing challenges. The core challenges we address are socioeconomic inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to essential resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing and education.\nKindly donate to our grant so we can start our journey of youth-led education for regeneration! With a match funding pool of over $25k thanks to the amazing GitCoin community, Celo and Celo Europe, every single dollar makes a big difference!\nWe intend to raise: 4000USD that will be consciously spent to achieve exponential outcomes:\n\n1. Host monthly community events: These will include expert guest speakers in ReFi, Web3 and urban challenges in African cities. We hope to engage young people from from RLabs, Younglings, and YOMA. We also hope to engage the City of Cape Town, Western Cape Government, Department of Basic Education, Stellenbosch University Centre for Sustainability Transitions, University of Cape Town, African Centre for Cities, ICLEI Africa, UNICEF, and private sector organisations interested in Web3 and sustainability.\n2. Host biannual hackathons: Focus on upskilling young local software developers. Problem statements encourage hackers to build user-friendly and mobile first dApps that address contextual challenges. Collaborate with other platforms who can provide technical support and infrastructure. \n\n3. Host a digital Impacts Marketplace: To use the ixo software stack to develop and host a ReFi Cape Town Impacts Marketplace. The objective of this is to support high-impact social projects in developing digital assets for impact measurement, verification and fundraising.\n",

          "description": "\nWe propose a comprehensive project that integrates tradition, emotion, and technology to foster a vibrant and connected community in Porto, Portugal. Through a multifaceted approach involving events, applications, protocols, and a web3-focused community, we aim to address burnout, nurture creativity, and unite local individuals with the principles of ReFi\n\n\nIn a world enamoured by technological advancement, it is crucial not to overlook the fragility of the human experience. Our project seeks to strike a harmonious balance between technological innovation and human connection. By nurturing inclusivity, collaboration, and cultural heritage, we aspire to build an empowered and united community.\n\nThe unchecked pace of technological evolution often neglects the intricate facets of human existence. The lack of space for empathy and understanding in technological advancements can lead to detachment, burnout, and societal estrangement. Within the heart of Porto, a city rich in history and resilience, the challenges of gentrification, economic disparity, and cultural erosion threaten to erode the city's unique identity. Our project endeavours to tackle these issues head-on by uniting and harvesting the individuals and causes that are already busy with these problems \n\nOur project revolves around an indirect strategy that encompasses somatic practices, immersive events, networking initiatives, and collaborative endeavours, all rooted in the principles of  community, locality and social impact technology. By doing so, we aim to forge a community of locals and web3 enthusiasts,  that employ ( or learn to employ) technology as a conduit for enriching human lives and resolving pressing societal dilemmas.\n\nOur Goals:\nEnhance Well-being: Introduce comprehensive somatic and therapeutic movement programs to combat burnout, stress, and mental fatigue, fostering a robust sense of physical and emotional well-being among community members.\n\nCatalyze Collaboration: Orchestrating an array of events, workshops, and hackathons that amalgamate local talents, artisans, grassroots leaders, and pioneering web3 enterprises, thereby facilitating meaningful interactions, ideation, and groundbreaking problem-solving.\n\nEmpower Microcosmic Communities: By offering infrastructure, resources, and networking platforms, we intend to galvanize artists, artisans, and community managers, enabling them to thrive, contribute, and catalyze local advancement.\n\nCounter Gentrification: In a proactive response to gentrification, our efforts will centre on nurturing local culture, amplifying distinctive talents, and  creating tools that help communities to fight against evictions \n\n\nComprising a dynamic cohort with diverse backgrounds spanning art, community management, production, and technological innovation, our team  is also all Porto Native. Our track record encompasses grassroots initiatives and state-funded projects, all underpinning our unyielding commitment to empowering Porto's thriving community.\n\nEfficient resource allocation is pivotal to actualize our visionary objectives. The budget breakdown will encompass:\nVenue procurement and equipment provisioning for events, workshops, and movement classes\nEngagement of distinguished guest speakers, trainers, and mentors for hackathons and networking sessions\nWeb3 development and aesthetic refinement of apps and protocols\nStrategic marketing and outreach initiatives to seamlessly integrate the community\nAdministrative and operational overhead\nThe establishment of an avant-garde co-working space tailored to accommodate nomadic entities\n\nElevate this transformative project by contributing to its realisation. Your participation will serve as a foundational pillar for cultivating a resilient community, kindling cross-disciplinary collaboration, and fortifying Porto's distinctive cultural narrative. Together, we can co-create a future wherein technology converges harmoniously with humanity.\n",

          "description": "ReFi Movement in Guadalajara: Bridging Regeneration \n\nIntroduction: We are at the forefront of a transformative movement in #Guadalajara. Our mission is to create a bridge between finances, technology, academia, public policy, and regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By emphasizing these intersections, we aim to empower Guadalajara's communities to address some of the city's most pressing challenges through workshops, incubation, and investment. These challenges encompass poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to essential resources such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\nProject Explanation: Through this initiative, we aim to deepen the understanding of ReFi in Guadalajara, particularly focusing on regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By doing so, we hope to enhance the environmental and social impact that new ventures can bring to the region. This renewed focus on ReFi projects and understanding will enable us to grow economically without compromising our environment and quality of life. Collaborating closely with ReFiDAO, we aim to onboard more individuals into the ReFi ecosystem, guiding them towards regenerative agricultural practices.\n\nObjective for Funding: Our primary goal is to conduct onboarding activities to increase awareness about the ReFi movement and the importance of transitioning to regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. By raising awareness of such projects and technologies, we believe they will align seamlessly with Guadalajara's trend of new technology-based ventures, gradually leading to a surge in ReFi companies in the region with a global footprint.\n\nAim: Our primary objective is to harness the power of open-source data generation, making it accessible to academia, government, and the private sector. This data-centric approach aims to expedite access to mechanisms such as carbon credits, biodiversity credits, and circular credits. These mechanisms, vital for the regeneration movement, heavily rely on data accessibility for verification. By democratizing access to this data, we aspire to foster a collaborative environment where various sectors can work in tandem to address Guadalajara's challenges, emphasizing regenerative agriculture and livestock practices.\n\nBudget: We intend to raise 28,200 USD, which will be strategically allocated to achieve the following ambitious outcomes:\n\nSoil Sampling for Project Baseline: 7,000 USD\nThis will fund comprehensive soil sampling across key agricultural areas in Guadalajara, establishing a baseline for future regenerative efforts and monitoring.\n\nKnowledge-Sharing Workshop on Carbon Sequestration: 4,500 USD\n\nA workshop aimed at sharing knowledge between communities about innovative methods to accelerate carbon sequestration. This will also cover ways to reduce costs on sampling for monitoring and verification using advanced technologies like Neural Networks and Satellite data.\n\nReplicable Model Presentation Workshop: 4,500 USD\nThis workshop will focus on presenting a replicable model for regenerative agriculture and livestock practices. It will serve as a blueprint for producers and stakeholders interested in transitioning to regenerative practices.\n\nInvestment Fund for Local Producers: 10,000 USD\nA dedicated fund to support agave, nopal, berries, and livestock producers. This fund will facilitate their transition to regenerative practices by providing them with tools, resources, and knowledge. It will act as a catalyst, ensuring that local producers have the necessary support to adopt and benefit from regenerative practices.\n\nOperational and Miscellaneous Costs: 2,200 USD\nThese funds will be reserved for any unforeseen expenses, ensuring the smooth execution of all planned activities.\n\nCity Overview: Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, is a unique blend of tradition and innovation. Historically rooted in agriculture and livestock, it has evolved into a tech hub, making it a nexus of technology and agriculture.\nSustainability Movements in Guadalajara:\nSEMADET: A testament to Jalisco's commitment to environmental sustainability, driving sustainable initiatives and policies.\n\nState Program for Climate Change Action: A comprehensive program addressing climate change, emphasizing vulnerability assessments, forest management, and adaptation strategies.\n\nOPD Bosque La Primavera: Dedicated to conserving the La Primavera Flora and Fauna Protection Area, ensuring the preservation of natural resources.\nEntrepreneurial and Investment Activity: Guadalajara is positioning itself as a digital and tech hub, with initiatives like Ciudad Creativa Digital and the Innovation Ministry & Startup Landing Pad.\nAgricultural and Tech Significance: Jalisco's agricultural prominence, especially in tequila production, combined with its tech expertise, offers a holistic approach to sustainable development.\nConservation and Restoration Potential: The Santiago River Basin, despite challenges from pollution and agricultural runoff, presents a unique opportunity for regeneration due to its ecological significance and conservation efforts.\n\nCity’s Needs and Tangible Impact Strategies:\nEnvironmental Awareness and Defense: Strengthening social awareness for environmental assets through community-driven campaigns and technology.\n\nWaste and Water Management: Addressing waste and water challenges through blockchain and industry collaboration.\nMobility and Traffic Management: Improving mobility using data analytics and promoting alternative transportation.\n\nRegenerative Agricultural and Livestock Practices: Transitioning to regenerative practices with financing mechanisms and corporate engagement.\nDecentralized Environmental Data: Creating a decentralized platform for data access using blockchain.\n\nValue Consensus through Technology: Establishing value consensus through blockchain platforms.\nMetrics for Success: Metrics include increased community participation, waste reduction, traffic flow improvement, adoption of regenerative practices, and data decentralization.\n\nTech/Startup Sector in Guadalajara: Guadalajara has become a major tech hub in Latin America, with a thriving ecosystem supported by local talent, educational institutions, and government.\n\nProject Overview: The Rancho El Mexicano (REM) initiative in Ixtlahuacán del Río focuses on nature conservation through sustainable and regenerative methodologies. The project aims to rejuvenate the local ecosystem, emphasizing soil health, carbon sequestration, and wildlife augmentation. It seeks to promote regenerative food production and stimulate economic growth by integrating ecosystem regeneration into a productive value chain.\n\nGeographic Focus: The project is located near the Santiago River and the Achichilco Stream, areas of significant ecological importance. The region faces pressures from agriculture, livestock farming, and agave production.\n\nProject Scalability and Replication: REM serves as a practical demonstration of sustainable land use, providing a replicable model for others. The project's scalability is enhanced by the establishment of a natural park, water harvesting initiatives, and the Santiago River initiative.\n\nBenefits of the Project:\nSocial: Inclusive education and training programs, community empowerment, and behavioral-centered design.\n\nEconomic: Augmenting resources for proficient management and promoting sustainable business practices.\n\nEnvironmental: Fostering ecosystem regeneration and continuous provision of ecosystem services.\nNature Credit Finance: The project seeks nature credit finance to support its conservation initiatives, addressing the degradation of the Santiago and Verde River Ravines. Nature credit finance represents an investment in the project and a sustainable future for the region.\n\nLink to Demand Motivation: The project addresses immediate threats to the region's land and broader systemic issues of climate change and biodiversity loss. It aims to transition the existing supply chain towards regenerative agriculture, offering solutions for climate change adaptation and combating land degradation. The project also emphasizes biodiversity monitoring and data generation, underscoring the systemic relationship between biodiversity and human life.\n",

          "description": "#  Refi Amsterdam \n##  Why Amsterdam needs a Refi node. \nAmsterdam has a rich history of financial innovation. The world’s first central bank and stock exchange were established here. The city has a forward-looking finance sector which is renowned for its commitment to sustainability. Amsterdam is the first in the world to adopt the doughnut economic model, it ranked second on the Global Green Finance Index and it topped the Schroders’ European Sustainable Cities Index in 2021, which found Amsterdam’s environmental policies the best in Europe. The scene is grounded in a vibrant tech and startup ecosystem and sustainability runs through all sectors, from finance to fashion and farming. \nNevertheless, the climate finance movement is lagging. We don't have as many climate finance startups as a London or Berlin has. Even though the web3 community is thriving and there is a huge legacy of the hippie movement since the 60’s, there is still a strong tendency towards profit over impact.  The role that blockchain can play in our path towards a regenerative society remains underexplored and untold. We believe there is a bridge to build between web3, sustainability and fintech, and therefore we’re raising funds to start a local node. \n\n##  How we’ll realize our vision\n-  **Community building and engagement.** Inspire, educate & spark meaningful conversations and increase awareness around Refi ‘gedachtegoed’. Organize gatherings for like minded people to enhance a sense of belonging and purpose and set up events in collaboration with other stakeholders in the ecosystem (such as universities, municipalities and local web3 communities such as, Copernicus and W3bLab amsterdam). \n\n-  **Empowering local startups and founders.** amplifying Refi startups based in NL  /projects (Kumo / Landlife / carbify / senken / carbon equity / Coorest / collectivo). \n-  **Facilitate collaboration** and build some cool shit during our monthly coworking sessions. \n\n\n##  What is needed to make this happen\nWe aim to raise a sum of 6k to kick-off a Refi node in Amsterdam in the upcoming 5 months .\n- 1x pm coworking  @Collectivo office for 8-10 people. 4x €500 = €2000\n- 1x Refi event @Beurs van Berlage. Theme carbon markets or Ubi €1500. \n- 1x Refi Salon icw Project Copernicus €500\n- Comms & project management: €2000\n\n##  The driving force behind ReFi Amsterdam:\n-  Cynthia de Wolf: Digital marketing consultant who loves to help accelerate startups. Active in web3 since 2017. Core contributor at brightunion.io. Passionate about building communities. Tech enthusiast, tree hugger. loves to dance. \n\n-  Luuk Weber: Long-term Regen and founder of Kolektivo Labs. Experience running community events in Amsterdam with Blockchain Talks all the way back in 2018.\n\n##  Conclusion \nRefi Amsterdam's goal of establishing a local node to connect web3, sustainability, and fintech aligns well with Amsterdam's history and values. By fostering community engagement, supporting local startups, and facilitating collaboration, Refi Amsterdam aims to contribute to the growth of climate finance initiatives in the city. The grant will enable the establishment of the Refi node and the realization of the initiative's vision. \n\n\n",
